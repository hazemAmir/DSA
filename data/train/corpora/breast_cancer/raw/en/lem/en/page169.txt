the protein phosphatase 1d magnesium-dependent , delta isoform ( ppm1d or wip1 ) , a member of the protein phosphatase @card@ c ( pp2c ) family , be express under various stress condition , such as ionize radiation and ultraviolet light , in a p53-dependent manner [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . ppm1d have be previously propose to influence multiple stress response pathway in the cell . first of all , ppm1d modulate p38 mapk signal cascade both in vivo and in vitro by dephosphorylating the threonine @card@ residue of p38 mapk [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . ppm1d thereby reduce the kinase activity of p38 mapk and thus also its ability to phosphorylate and activate the p53 tumor suppressor protein [ @card@ ] . similarly , ppm1d efficiently dephosphorylates the serine residue on p53 itself , as well as atm , chk1 , chk2 , and ung2 , all of which be key cell cycle checkpoint effector or dna damage response and repair protein [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . in addition , ppm1d have be suggest to inhibit p16ink4a and p19arf tumor suppressor activity [ @card@ ] . together , these datum support an essential role for ppm1d as a homeostatic regulator of multiple cellular growth and stress regulatory response and dna damage repair pathway .
ppm1d be frequently amplify and overexpressed in primary human breast cancer as well as in several other human tumor type , include neuroblastomas , ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma , and medulloblastomas [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . furthermore , ppm1d amplification and overexpression be associate with poor clinical outcome [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . interestingly , the majority of primary breast tumor that overexpress ppm1d have a structurally intact tp53 gene [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . this finding support the hypothesis that ppm1d activation represent an alternative mechanism that lead to inactivation of p53 in cancer ; p53 mutation and ppm1d activation be therefore mutually exclusive event that elicit the same end result .
several line of evidence implicate ppm1d in cancer pathogenesis . first of all , in vitro study have demonstrate that ppm1d can complement ras , myc , and neu oncogene for cellular transformation of primary mouse embryo fibroblast [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . recently , ppm1d be also find to promote tumorigenesis in vivo in mouse mammary epithelium in cooperation with the erbb2 ( neu ) oncogene [ @card@ ] . base on these datum , ppm1d can be regard as a weak oncogene . in contrast , the absence of ppm1d be show to lead to tumor resistant phenotype . ppm1d-deficient mouse embryo fibroblast be resistant to transformation with several different oncogene and inactivation of ppm1d also inhibit mammary tumorigenesis in these animal [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] .
together , these study illustrate that ppm1d be clearly involve in cellular stress response and tumor development and thus could be consider as a promising cancer therapy target . the datum on the function of ppm1d , however , have be derive almost exclusively from in vitro and in vivo mouse study . the exact role of ppm1d in the pathogenesis of human breast cancer have not be fully establish . in this study , we use an rna interference ( rnai ) technique to silence ppm1d expression in breast cancer cell line to explore the function and phenotypic consequence of ppm1d overexpression in human breast cancer .

@ord@ discussion
ppm1d be a growth-promoting phosphatase that act as a weak oncogene in transformation assay by complement the action of various oncogene [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . ppm1d be also commonly amplify and overexpressed in a number of human malignancy , and this event have be associate with more aggressive disease [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . furthermore , analysis of ppm1d-null mouse have reveal defect in reproductive organ , immune function , and cell cycle control , indicate that ppm1d have a number of important biological function [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] .
in this study , we concentrate on explore the functional role of ppm1d overexpression in breast cancer . to this end , we apply rnai technology to specifically downregulate ppm1d mrna level in breast cancer cell line harbor amplification and overexpression of this gene . our analysis reveal that ppm1d silence have a strong antiproliferative effect in zr-75-1 breast cancer cell . less dramatic reduction in cell growth be also observe in mcf7 cell , and bt-474 cell show no change in cell growth rate .
these difference in cell behavior be intriguing , give that all three cell line do have high level of ppm1d expression and there be no substantial difference in the efficiency of ppm1d silence . one aspect that might explain these diverse response be the p53 status of the cell . zr-75-1 and mcf7 cell carry wild-type p53 , whereas bt-474 harbor mutant p53 [ @card@ ] . because inactivation of p53 be one of the main consequence of ppm1d activation [ @card@ ] , it could be expect that ppm1d downregulation do not have an effect on cell growth in p53-deficient cell , such as bt-474 . our datum thus suggest that the antiproliferative effect of ppm1d be dependent on the p53 status of the cell . it be also possible , however , that other factor contribute to the differential response of ppm1d silence in these cell line . for example , bt-474 cell may not be dependent on ppm1d but rather rely on other proliferation and survival pathway .
the mechanism that lead to reduce cell growth in zr-75-1 and mcf7 cell after ppm1d silence be not completely clear . the flow cytometric cell cycle analysis show a large fraction of zr-75-1 cell in s and g2 phase of the cell cycle after ppm1d sirna than for the control sirna treatment ; however , this effect be observe only at @card@ hour after transfection and be thus likely to reflect contact inhibition in the fully confluent control sirna culture , rather than an actual change in the cell cycle profile in ppm1d-depleted cell . because of their slow growth rate , the ppm1d sirna-transfected cell have not yet reach confluency at this time point . in contrast , our datum do suggest that ppm1d downregulation lead to increase apoptosis in zr-75-1 cell and therefore the reduce growth rate be likely to be explain by induction of programmed cell death . similar induction of apoptosis be not observe in mcf7 cell , and thus the growth reduction observe in these cell remain unexplained . nevertheless , our datum suggest the involvement of ppm1d in regulation of essential prosurvival pathway .
our result from breast cancer be consistent with a previous report on neuroblastoma cell line , in which ppm1d silence be also show to suppress cell growth and induce apoptosis [ @card@ ] . furthermore , ppm1d knockdown have earlier be find to enhance apoptosis after dna damage and e2f1 induction [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . these finding be further corroborate by datum demonstrate decrease proliferative capacity and premature senescence in mouse embryo fibroblast from ppm1d-null mouse [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . moreover , recent study have also indicate that small-molecule inhibitor of ppm1d be capable of reduce tumor cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo [ @card@ ] . take together , these finding confirm the role of ppm1d in regulation of cell proliferation and further implicate it as an essential regulator of cell survival in breast cancer . base on these characteristic , ppm1d be an appealing target for the development of novel anticancer treatment .
