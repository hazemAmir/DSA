neoadjuvant chemotherapy be an important tool for the treatment of breast cancer patient with locally advanced disease . however , up to @card@ % of woman who receive preoperative cytotoxic therapy do not respond to the treatment ( [ ellis et al. , 1998a ] and [ ellis et al. , 1998b ] ) . then , we need to identify those patient that will not respond to certain chemotherapy to offer them other treatment strategy . in spite of the different mechanism of action , most cytotoxic drug use in the clinic induce apoptosis and among the molecular mechanism involve in chemoresistance be the alteration in critical pathway of the apoptosis cascade initiate by the cytotoxic drug . there be two principal pathway lead to apoptosis , one begin in the plasma membrane with the presence of cell-surface death receptor and the other begin in the mitochondrion . the mitochondrial pathway be regulate by member of the bcl-2 protein family ; some of them function as promoter ( e.g. , Bax ) and other as inhibitor ( e.g. , bcl-2 ) . the member of the bcl-2 protein family interact form homo- and heterodimers ; the ratio of antiapoptotic : proapoptotic protein , rather than either alone ( for example , bcl-2 : bax instead of bcl-2 alone ) dictate the ultimate sensitivity or resistance of tumor cell to apoptosis .
the bcl-2 gene encode two bcl-2 protein isoforms , and ; be the commonly detect isoform with a molecular weight of @card@ kda whereas protein , with a molecular weight of @card@ kda , be rarely detect ( tsujimoto and croce , @card@ ) . bcl-2 protein be localize in the inner surface of the plasma membrane , the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane , the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear membrane . in breast cancer , the expression of bcl-2 have be associate with the presence of marker of differentiation and with a long survival in node-negative or node-positive patient ( [ daidone et al. , 1999a ] and [ daidone et al. , 1999b ] ) . since bcl-2 have a positive correlation with estrogen receptor alpha ( er ) status , it raise the possibility that bcl-2 be an er-regulated gene ( doglioni et al. , @card@ ) . in fact , it have be find that bcl-2 expression be a marker of tamoxifen sensitivity in breast cancer patient ( [ elledge et al. , @card@ ] and [ ciocca and elledge , @card@ ] ) . it have be widely demonstrate that bcl-2 can prevent the apoptosis induce by chemotherapeutic drug ( include doxorubicin ) in cancer cell line ( ohmori et al. , @card@ ) . however , in breast cancer patient the role of bcl-2 as a predictive marker of resistance / sensitivity to chemotherapy be still controversial and there be no report evaluate bcl-2 as prognostic marker in neoadjuvant therapy . a prognostic factor be a measurement that be associate with clinical outcome in the absence of therapy or with the application of a standard therapy that all patient be likely to receive . a predictive factor be a measurement that be associate with benefit or lack of benefit from a particular therapy . in some study with adjuvant therapy , high bcl-2 expression have be find to be relate to a good response to chemotherapy ( gasparini et al. , @card@ ) , whereas other author have find a bcl-2 association with resistance to chemotherapy ( bonetti et al. , @card@ ) . in study with neoadjuvant chemotherapy , some author do not find any correlation of bcl-2 with the response to the treatment ( [ daidone et al. , 1999a ] , [ daidone et al. , 1999b ] and [ bottini et al. , @card@ ] ) while other observe that the absence of bcl-2 in the tumor before chemotherapy correlate with a well pathological response ( ogston et al. , @card@ ) .
Bax ( bcl-2-associated protein x ) be the archetypal proapoptotic protein of the bcl-2 family . bax gene can produce different protein through mrna alternative splice mechanism include , , , and isoforms ( apte et al. , @card@ ) . bax be the commonly detect isoform with a molecular weight of @card@ kda , it move from cytoplasm to mitochondrion follow an apoptotic stimulus and form heterodimeric complex with bcl-2 . in metastatic breast cancer patient , reduce bax expression have be associate with short survival ( Krajewski et al. , @card@ ) .
the tumor suppressor gene p53 be involve in the regulation of apoptosis . the wild-type ( wt ) p53 be a check-point protein that induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis . wt p53 transcriptionally down-regulates the expression of the bcl-2 gene and activate the expression of the bax gene ( miyashita et al. , @card@ ) . in human breast carcinoma , an inverse correlation between p53 immunostaining , a surrogate end-marker of mutant p53 protein as describe elsewhere ( elledge and allred , @card@ ) and bcl-2 expression have be report ( [ silvestrini et al. , @card@ ] and [ Krajewski et al. , @card@ ] ) .
in order to advance our knowledge on the usefulness of evaluate the expression level of bcl-2 in breast cancer patient , we conduct this study to correlate the expression of this protein with clinical and pathological response to chemotherapy and with the survival of the patient .
@ord@ results2.1 . effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on bcl-2 expression
this part of the study ( that be not our principal goal ) be perform in @card@ match sample from fac / fec group ( 5-fluorouracil , adriamycin or epirubicin , and cyclophosphamide ) and @card@ match sample from d / e group ( doxorubicin or epirubicin ) ; in the other sample we do not have enough pre-chemotherapy material because the biopsy be obtain by fine-needle ( n = @card@ ) or the core biopsy ( n = @card@ ) be destine to other analysis .
bcl-2 stain be confine to the cytoplasm of tumor cell . in all section of tumor sample we observe area with infiltrate lymphocyte which we use as an internal positive control because these cell express bcl-2 in their cytoplasm ( figure @card@ ) . in the fac / fec group , bcl-2 be markedly positive ( @card@ % of stain cell ) in @card@ % ( @card@ / @card@ ) of the tumor remove before chemotherapy ; after chemotherapy the protein remain unchanged in @card@ case ( @card@ % ) , decrease in @card@ case ( @card@ % ) , increase in @card@ case ( @card@ % ) , and it be negative in @card@ case ( @card@ % ) . a high apoptotic index ( ai ) be more frequently find among the case with low bcl-2 expression compare to the case with high bcl-2 content , but this inverse correlation be not statistically significant . the mean ai evaluate with hematoxylin and eosin ( he ) be @card@ % ( range @card@ - @card@ % ) and @card@ % ( range @card@ - @card@ % ) before and after chemotherapy , respectively . similar mean value be obtain with the tunel , @card@ % ( range @card@ - @card@ % ) and @card@ % ( range @card@ - @card@ % ) in pre and post-chemotherapy biopsy , respectively . four patient ( @card@ % ) show a @card@ % increase in the ai evaluate by he follow chemotherapy , whereas in @card@ case ( @card@ % ) the ai value decrease , and there be no change in @card@ case ( @card@ % ) . eight patient ( @card@ % ) show a @card@ % increase in the ai evaluate by tunel follow chemotherapy , whereas in @card@ case ( @card@ % ) the value decrease , and the value remain unchanged in @card@ case ( @card@ % ) . we find a trend for a correlation between ai-he and ai-tunel in post-chemotherapy sample ( spearman ' s rank correlation coefficient , r = @card@ , p = @card@ ) .

in order to know if the antibody against bcl-2 might also reveal the presence of bcl-2 fragment generate during apoptosis ( which be pro-apoptotic molecule ) we decide to perform a western blot study ( figure @card@ ) . we corroborate the specific reaction against bcl-2 ( the only band be that of @card@ kda ) ; and when the time of exposition with the chemiluminescence reagent be increase from @card@ S to @card@ min , and to @card@ min , two other great molecular weight band ( but no small band ) be observe .

it be interesting to note that patient from d / e group have good dfs and os than patient from fac / fec group ( cox model , p = @card@ and p = @card@ , respectively ) . however , the interaction between the two treatment regimen and bcl-2 status be not statistically significant , then bcl-2 do not have predictive significance in our study .
@ord@ discussion
previous researcher have explore the value of bcl-2 protein as predictive or prognostic factor to adjuvant treatment in breast cancer ( [ gasparini et al. , @card@ ] , [ bonetti et al. , @card@ ] , [ sjstrm et al. , @card@ ] and [ lee et al. , @card@ ] ) . however , there be few analysis in a homogeneous group of patient treat with neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( bottini et al. , @card@ ) . in our study , we do not find statistically significant change in the ai and in the expression of bcl-2 , bax , and p53 after chemotherapy when the complete fac / fec group be analyze ( difference in individual patient be note ) . in a group of the surgical specimen ( follow chemotherapy ) , Ellis et al . have report that the ai be reduce , and the bcl-2 expression show a significant increase ( [ ellis et al. , 1998a ] and [ ellis et al. , 1998b ] ) . the discrepancy with our result may be explain by the fact that the combination of cytotoxic drug ( cisplatin , epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil ) , dose and schedule of administration to the patient be different . parton et al . have report that the ai and bax rise @card@ h follow chemoendocrine therapy , but they do not study what happen in the surgical specimen ( parton et al. , @card@ ) .
it be interesting to note that we observe nuclear expression of bax in some of the breast cancer sample ; this unusual localization have previously be observe in cultured cell include human breast cancer cell ( [ nishita et al. , @card@ ] , [ wang et al. , @card@ ] and [ hoetelmans et al. , @card@ ] ) . it have be show that in some circumstance bax translocate into the nucleus ( e.g. , after hyperthermia ) and it may be involve in the transmigration of other protein . in our study , nuclear expression of bax do not correlate with the clinical response of the tumor or with the outcome of the patient . further study will be necessary to elucidate the role of bax in the nuclear compartment of breast tumor cell before and after drug administration .
we do not find any correlation between bcl-2 expression and the clinical and pathological response , which be consistent with previous report ( makris et al. , @card@ ) . it be important to mention that Pusztai et al . find that the absence of bcl-2 expression in pre-chemotherapy specimen be associate with more frequent complete pathological response ( pusztai et al. , @card@ ) . despite these consideration , we should remember here that in our study the clinical response of the tumor be not a good parameter to predict the survival of the patient .
in the present study , high bcl-2 expression at time of surgery correlate with good dfs and os in fac / fec and d / e group . it be not clear why bcl-2 represent a molecular marker for good prognosis in breast cancer patient treat with neoadjuvant chemotherapy . at this point , some consideration should be take into account : 1 ) the determination of bcl-2 status alone be not sufficient for assess the competency of this protein in the apoptosis pathway because it form heterodimers with other bcl-2 family member . we study the bcl-2 : bax ratio in the fac / fec group and we observe that a bcl-2 : bax ratio @card@ also correlate with good dfs . therefore , we believe that it would be necessary to determine the expression of all the other member of bcl-2 family that interact with bcl-2 , to know the real implication of this protein in the apoptotic pathway induce by chemotherapy . 2 ) after the induction of apoptosis , the activate caspases cleave bcl-2 at asp34 and transform the bcl-2 protein to an inducer of cell death ( cheng et al. , @card@ ) . we perform a western blot to know if in our biopsy we be recognize the whole bcl-2 molecule and the proapoptotic fragment , we corroborate that the antibody use recognize only the whole molecule . 3 ) the level of expression of bcl-2 be crucial to determine its role on apoptosis as describe by shinoura et al . ( @card@ ) . these author perform cell transfection study show that a high expression of bcl-2 be proapoptotic while a relatively low bcl-2 expression be antiapoptotic discuss the molecular mechanism for these paradoxical effect . if this be true , then the tumor cell with high bcl-2 expression that escape the primary tumor may be more sensitive to chemotherapy explain the good dfs / os . however , we should remember that the remain cell in the tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy be mainly those that become resistant to the drug ( alternatively , it be also possible that these cell be not reach by the drug ) and that if these cell be not completely remove ( by surgery , chemotherapy and radiation therapy ) they will be the responsible of treatment failure at local level ( local recurrence ) and perhaps they will be the source for metastasis . we have examine the primary tumor but we do not know what be happen with the cell that already escape from the primary tumor . we hypothesize that the breast tumor cell overexpressing bcl-2 become more resistant to chemotherapy ( at least this be what we see in the surgical specimen obtain after induction chemotherapy ) , but they have a less aggressive behavior ( they be less able to produce metastasis ) , and for this reason primary tumor contain bcl-2 overexpression be relate to a good survival . this explanation be consistent with the result obtain by Neri et al . ; which may indicate that the expression of bcl-2 be a marker of breast cancer with reduce capability of distant colonization even in presence of lymphovascular invasion ( neri et al. , @card@ ) . in other word , we be support the conclusion of Bonetti et al . that bcl-2 positive tumor have low response to chemotherapy but good survival ( bonetti et al. , @card@ ) . one explanation may be the anti-proliferative activity of bcl-2 ( Huang et al. , @card@ ) . Deng et al . have show that bcl-2 may negatively regulate g1 / s transition by a mechanism involve the increase expression of antioxidant enzyme ( superoxide dismutase and catalase ) , which in turn reduce intracellular reactive oxigen species level and this be dependent of phosphorylation status of bcl-2 ( deng et al. , @card@ ) . then , we examine the cell proliferation in bcl-2 positive tumor to know whether a tumor overexpressing bcl-2 protein have low proliferation . we compare pcna ( proliferate cell nuclear antigen ) expression with bcl-2 expression but we do not observe any significant correlation ( datum not show ) . 4 ) finally , the good survival of patient with positive bcl-2 tumor may be explain by the correlation with er content in d / e group ( all of the patient whose tumor have er receive hormone therapy after chemotherapy ) . this explanation be not sufficient to explain the good survival of patient with bcl-2 positive tumor in fac / fec , because er status do not correlate with bcl-2 expression , and er be only marginally useful to predict disease-free interval and it be not useful to predict overall survival .
we find that a high bcl-2 expression have no predictive value but have a prognostic value in breast cancer patient treat with doxorubicin / epirubicin neoadjuvant chemotherapy . further study will be necessary to elucidate why bcl-2 protein be an important prognostic marker in breast cancer patient .

the cutoff use to determine if a marker be positive or negative be choose base upon previous study demonstrate their clinical significance . the immunoreactive cell for bcl-2 and p53 be dichotomize into two group , @card@ or @card@ % , while the cutoff of bax be @card@ % ( [ Krajewski et al. , @card@ ] and [ vargas-roig et al. , @card@ ] ) . the immunoreactive cell for hormone receptor be dichotomize into two group , @card@ or @card@ of total score ( intensity and proportion ) ; the intensity score use be : no stain = @card@ , weak stain = @card@ , moderate stain = @card@ and strong stain = @card@ ; and the proportion score use be : @card@ % = @card@ , @card@ - @card@ % = @card@ , @card@ - @card@ % = @card@ , @card@ - @card@ % = @card@ and @card@ % = @card@ ( vargas-roig et al. , @card@ ) .
@card@ . western blot
part of some breast cancer sample be store at @card@ c until western blot analysis be perform . total protein sample ( @card@ and @card@ g ) be subject to @card@ % sds-page follow by transfer onto nitrocellulose filter , as previously describe ( fanelli et al. , @card@ ) . the antibody to bcl-2 be dilute at @card@ : @ord@ for detection of the immunocomplexes , chemiluminescence reagent be use follow the manufacturer ' s instruction ( dupont nen , boston , ma ) .
@card@ . statistical analysis
the wilcoxon sign rank non-parametric test be use to determine whether difference find in the pre- and post-chemotherapy biopsy be significant . the strength of association between ai-he and tunel , as well as the correlation between the marker study be calculate use the spearman ' s rank correlation coefficient . fisher ' s exact test be use to determine whether the expression of the marker study correlate significantly with the clinical and pathological response and outcome of the patient . analysis of dfs and os be perform by the kaplan - meier method . the difference between curve be evaluate with the log-rank test for censor survival or event observation . the predictive significance of bcl-2 be evaluate with logistic regression and cox model contain term for the main effect of treatment and bcl-2 . statistical analysis be perform use the prism computer program ( graph pad software , san diego , ca ) and spss @card@ program ; a p @card@ be consider significant .
