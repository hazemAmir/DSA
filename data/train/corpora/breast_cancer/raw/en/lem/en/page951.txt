osteoporosis be a skeletal disease characterize by decrease bone strength , altered bone architecture , and increase risk of fracture and be clinically define as bone mineral density ( bmd ) that be @card@ standard deviation or more below the mean bmd for young adult woman ( t-score2.5 ) . [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] low bmd , history of fracture , and age be three of the strong prognostic factor for subsequent osteoporosis-related fractures.4 a high rate of bone loss occur early in the transition from pre- to postmenopause , when as much as @card@ - @card@ % of bone be lose each year.5 this rate of bone loss then slow to approximately @card@ % per year when woman enter the postmenopausal phase.5
in general , the increase bone loss observe during and after menopause can be attribute to the natural decrease in estrogen level . because estrogen have a negative regulatory effect on bone-resorbing osteoclast , a decrease in estrogen level will increase the rate of bone resorption and thereby increase fracture risk . this association between estrogen and elevated fracture risk be observe in a large , prospective study in postmenopausal woman @card@ year of age.6 baseline serum estrogen level in woman with hip or vertebral fracture ( n = @card@ ) be compare with serum estrogen level in woman with no fracture ( n = @card@ ) . after adjustment for weight and age , woman with undetectable serum estradiol level have an approximate @card@ % great risk of hip and vertebral fracture than woman with low but detectable levels.6 therefore , it appear that woman with undetectable serum estradiol concentration ( @card@ pg / ml ) be at increase risk of hip and vertebral fracture .
in addition to the contribution of low estrogen to increase fracture risk , epidemiologic study in large population of postmenopausal woman have seek to identify additional fracture risk factor that be independent of bmd status . in a prospective study of @card@ healthy postmenopausal woman , independent predictor of fracture include age @card@ year , prior fall , leave grip strength , maternal fracture history , low physical activity , and personal fragility fracture history . several additional risk factor , however , include body weight , weight loss , and smoking , do not predict fracture risk independent of bmd.7 another study in nearly @card@ , @card@ postmenopausal woman identify risk factor that contribute to hip fracture . the author conclude that individual risk factor each have a minimal effect on fracture risk but that the combination of multiple risk factor significantly increase fracture risk.8 furthermore , woman in this study with low bmd and multiple risk factor have the great risk of fracture , @card@ suggest that a comprehensive risk assessment may well identify woman at risk of fracture .
bone loss and fracture risk during breast cancer therapy
woman with breast cancer may already have an elevated risk of fracture compare with age-matched woman with no history of cancer . in addition to fracture risk factor experience by healthy postmenopausal woman , breast cancer and its therapy may increase bone turnover and bone loss . furthermore , direct toxic effect of some chemotherapy treatment may also contribute to the increase in fracture risk .
evidence for high fracture risk in breast cancer survivor come from a prospective , longitudinal cohort study of postmenopausal woman enroll in the woman ' S health initiative observational study ( whi-os ) @card@ fracture datum be collect from postmenopausal breast cancer survivor ( n = @card@ ) and woman without breast cancer ( n = @card@ , @card@ ) and adjust for age , body weight , ethnicity , and region of enrollment . in this analysis , woman with breast cancer have a @card@ % increase risk of fracture compare with woman without breast cancer.9 in another study , woman with breast cancer and no bone metastasis have a nearly five-fold increase risk of vertebral fracture compare with healthy age-matched woman , and that risk increase to approximately 23-fold in woman with recurrent soft-tissue disease ( p0.0001 for both ) @card@ take together , the result from these clinical trial indicate that survivor of breast cancer be at increase risk of fracture .
chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer be of particular concern in premenopausal woman because chemotherapy-induced premature menopause may result in rapid and significant bone loss.11 in contrast to premenopausal woman who experience bone loss secondary to premature ovarian failure , postmenopausal woman may experience direct negative effect of chemotherapy on bone metabolism . a retrospective chart review demonstrate that postmenopausal woman who undergo chemotherapy for early breast cancer experience a significant decrease in bmd compare with woman who have not receive chemotherapy.12 moreover , the author of the study suggest that the observed bmd decrease ( @card@ standard deviation ) in patient who receive chemotherapy may result in an approximate @card@ % increase risk of fracture.12
in addition to chemotherapy , woman with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer may also receive aromatase inhibitor ( ai ) as part of their adjuvant regimen . although ai therapy have demonstrate significant improvement in disease-free survival compare with tamoxifen , it be also associate with increase bone loss and fracture incidence . because low-level estrogen be bone protective in postmenopausal woman , depletion of residual estrogen during ai therapy result in significant bone loss . in the anastrozole , tamoxifen , alone or in combination ( atac ) trial , woman receive anastrozole have elevate level of biochemical marker of bone turnover and experienced significant bmd loss at both the lumbar spine ( @card@ % ) and total hip ( @card@ % ) after @card@ year of therapy ( p0.0001 ) @card@ bone loss continue throughout the duration of therapy and , after @card@ year of anastrozole treatment , patient have experience an approximate @card@ % bmd decline compare with patient who receive tamoxifen ( @card@ % at lumbar spine ; @card@ % at total hip ; p0.0001 for both ) @card@ fracture incidence be also significantly high in patient receive anastrozole compare with tamoxifen ( @card@ % vs. @card@ % , respectively ; p0.0001 ; fig . 1 ) . [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ]

increase bone loss and fracture incidence appear to be common side effect of all ai therapy ( fig . 1 ) . [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] after @card@ year of therapy , woman enroll in the breast international group ( big @card@ - @card@ ; n = @card@ ) study who receive letrozole experience significantly more fracture than woman who receive tamoxifen ( @card@ % vs. @card@ % ; p0.001 ) @card@ woman in the letrozole monotherapy arm ( n = @card@ ) continue to have significantly more fracture than woman in the tamoxifen monotherapy arm ( n = @card@ ) after @card@ year of treatment ( @card@ % vs. @card@ % ; p0.001 ) @card@ similarly , the 58-month result from the intergroup exemestane study ( ies ) show that fracture be significantly more frequent in woman who switch to exemestane compare with woman who continue on tamoxifen ( @card@ % vs. @card@ % ; p = @card@ ) @card@ overall , result from the ai trial indicate that patient will experience significant bone loss and be at increase risk of fracture . thus , treatment strategy that allow patient to gain the clinical benefit of ai therapy without increase fracture risk be need .
manage fracture risk in patient with breast cancer
it be clear that many breast cancer therapy that improve patient survival and reduce disease recurrence may also have a detrimental effect on bone health . unfortunately , guideline for the management of bone health in woman with breast cancer have fall behind currently available clinical trial datum . as outline in the American society of clinical oncology ( asco ) guideline , annual bmd screening be recommend in patient who be at high risk of experience fracture . however , only patient who fall below the threshold for osteoporosis ( t-score2.5 ) be direct to receive pharmacologic therapy ( i.e. , alendronate , risedronate , zoledronic acid , or raloxifene ) @card@ in this setting , an osteoporotic threshold may be too low to identify woman who be at an increase risk of fracture . for example , in a large observational study ( n = @card@ , @card@ ) in healthy postmenopausal woman , the majority of woman ( @card@ % ) who sustain osteoporotic fracture within @card@ year of bmd testing have t-scores great than @card@ furthermore , @card@ % of fracture occur in woman with osteopenic t-scores ( @card@ to @card@ ) , and these woman would not have be consider for therapeutic intervention use the t-score threshold specify in the asco guideline . [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] available datum from the livial intervention follow breast cancer efficacy , recurrence , and tolerability endpoints ( liberate ) trial suggest that woman with breast cancer may have significant bone loss before beginning ai therapy.23 measurement of baseline lumbar spine bmd indicate that @card@ % of patient be osteoporotic ( t-score @card@ ) and @card@ % be osteopenic ( t-score @card@ to @card@ ) before initiate treatment in the study.23 this suggest that at least @card@ % of woman begin ai therapy may already have considerable bone loss .
a number of therapeutic option be available for the pharmacologic prevention of postmenopausal bone loss ; however , several of these treatment may be problematic in the context of patient with breast cancer . in particular , hormone-replacement therapy may promote tumorigenesis or reduce the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy in hormone-sensitive cancer . furthermore , oral bisphosphonates administer at dose indicate for the treatment of osteoporosis may be insufficient to protect bone in the face of bone loss accelerate by cancer treatment . in this setting , evidence from several clinical trial indicate that the most viable treatment option to prevent ai-associated bone loss ( aibl ) and the associate fracture may be intravenous nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates . to that end , the intravenous bisphosphonate zoledronic acid have be examine in three clinical trial for prevention of aibl in both pre- and postmenopausal woman undergo ai therapy .
ovarian ablation combine with endocrine therapy in premenopausal woman with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer result in the near-complete suppression of estrogen production and may increase the risk of bone loss and fracture . the Austrian breast and colorectal cancer study group ( abcsg-12 ) trial compare goserelin ovarian suppression plus tamoxifen or anastrozole in premenopausal woman with hormone-responsive breast cancer . in a bmd substudy of this trial , patient receive endocrine treatment with or without zoledronic acid @card@ mg every @card@ month , and bmd be measure at baseline and at @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ month . woman who receive endocrine therapy without concurrent zoledronic acid experience significant overall bone loss throughout the @card@ year of treatment . after @card@ month , patient receive anastrozole have a significant @card@ % bmd loss at the lumbar spine and an @card@ % bmd loss at the hip ( p0.0001 and @card@ , respectively ) compare with baseline ( fig . 2 ) @card@ in a similar manner , patient who receive tamoxifen experienced bmd loss of @card@ % at the spine and @card@ % at the hip ( p0.0001 and = @card@ , respectively ) @card@ however , bmd be unaffected by endocrine therapy in woman who receive concurrent zoledronic acid and remain stable throughout the @card@ month of treatment ( fig . 2 ) @card@ furthermore , zoledronic acid significantly decrease the proportion of patient who become osteopenic during endocrine therapy ( p0.0001 ) and prevent patient receive anastrozole from become osteoporotic.24 these result demonstrate that premenopausal woman receive endocrine therapy for breast cancer be subject to significant bone loss at both the spine and hip . zoledronic acid administer every @card@ month during endocrine treatment can prevent cancer treatment-induced bone loss in this patient population .

postmenopausal woman already have significantly reduce estrogen production , and ai therapy can deplete residual estrogen level , thus increase bone loss and fracture risk . the companion zometa / femara adjuvant synergy trial ( z-fast and zo-fast ) will evaluate @card@ mg zoledronic acid administer every @card@ month for prevention of aibl in patient with breast cancer receive letrozole.25 patient be randomize to receive zoledronic acid concomitantly with ai therapy ( upfront ) or at the first sign of significant bone loss ( t-score @card@ or fracture ; i.e. , delayed ) . after @card@ month on the z-fast study , patient who receive upfront zoledronic acid experience bmd increase of @card@ % at the lumbar spine and @card@ % at the hip , while woman in the delayed group experience significant bmd loss ( @card@ % and @card@ % , respectively ; p0.0001 for both ; fig . 3 ) @card@ the observed bmd change within each group appear to correlate with change in biochemical marker of bone metabolism . serum level of n-telopeptide of type i collagen ( ntx ) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase ( balp ) be significantly increase in the delayed group and significantly decrease in the upfront group.26 recently , combined 12-month datum from z-fast and zo-fast be present , and this integrated analysis confirm that upfront zoledronic acid prevent bone loss during ai therapy.27 furthermore , result in patient who complete @card@ year of therapy indicate that upfront zoledronic acid continue to suppress marker of bone metabolism , and patient gain @card@ % and @card@ % bmd at the lumbar spine and total hip over the delayed group.28 additional follow-up of these trial will define the long-term benefit of zoledronic acid combine with ai in early stage breast cancer .

conclusion
datum from multiple clinical trial indicate that patient with breast cancer be at increase risk of fracture compare with healthy postmenopausal woman . current guideline for bone health management in patient with breast cancer rely on osteoporotic bmd as a treatment indicator and fail to identify a large proportion of woman at risk of fracture . in addition to the risk factor experience by healthy postmenopausal woman , such as low bmd , age , personal history of fragility fracture , family history of hip fracture , use of glucocorticoids , and low body mass index , patient with breast cancer be expose to numerous unique fracture risk factor . clearly , breast cancer alone appear to increase the risk of fracture independent of other risk , and treatment include chemotherapy , gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue , and ai therapy can have a profound negative effect on bone health and thereby increase fracture risk . as such , future bone health management guideline will need to include a comprehensive fracture risk assessment to guide treatment decision .
modern treatment for breast cancer have significantly prolonged patient survival , and ai therapy have further extended disease-free survival beyond what have be achieve with tamoxifen . one consequence of improve survival be the increase need to address bone health issue in these patient . fortunately , clinical trial have demonstrate the efficacy of zoledronic acid for the prevention of aibl when administer concurrently with endocrine therapy . therefore , zoledronic acid in combination with ai may optimize clinical outcome by allow patient to receive the most effective treatment without increase fracture risk .
