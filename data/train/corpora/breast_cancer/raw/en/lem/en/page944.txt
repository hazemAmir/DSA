vasoactive intestinal peptide ( vip ) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide ( pacap ) receptor know as vpac1 , vpac2 and pac1 have be show to be overexpressed on human tumor [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . for these receptor , two primary peptide have high affinity [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . first , the vip , a 28-amino acid , hydrophobic peptide , isolate from porcine intestine [ @card@ ] . vip have three lysine ( lys ) residue ( at position @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ ) , two tyrosine ( tyr ) residue ( at position @card@ and @card@ ) , two arginine ( arg ) residue ( at position @card@ and @card@ ) , an essential histidine ( his ) residue at the n terminus and ( asn ) amidated c-terminus . all @card@ amino acid be require for full biologic activity of vip [ @card@ ] . second , the pituitary adenylate cyclase activate polypeptide ( pacap ) . this 38-amino acid peptide be isolate from bovine hypothalamus [ @card@ ] . pacap be find to stimulate accumulation of intracellular and extracellular camp in rat anterior pituitary cell [ @card@ ] . later gottschall et al [ @card@ ] isolate a @card@ amino acid peptide ( pacap27 ) from bovine hypothalamus which they observe to have similar property as pacap38 . pacap27 share a homology of @card@ amino acid with vip28 . like vip28 , pacap27 also have an amidated ( leu ) c-terminal and his at the n-terminal .
the biological action of vip and pacap be mediate by a family of three g protein-coupled receptor , which be designate as vpac1 , vpac2 and pac1 [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . these gene receptor be also detect on the cell membrane of normal intestinal and bronchial epithelial cell [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] , albeit receptor density have not be specify . for human tumor on the other hand , study have reveal that vpac1 , vpac2 , and pac1 receptor be locate at the plasma membrane of the tumor cell [ @card@ ] . among the tumor on which vpac1 receptor have be find in high density and high incidence , include cancer of breast , prostate and urinary bladder ( @card@ % ) , colon ( @card@ % ) , pancreas ( @card@ % ) , lung ( @card@ % ) , stomach ( @card@ % ) , and liver ( @card@ % ) [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] .
with the goal that radiolabeled vip28 can specifically target these receptor for in vivo visualization of some of these human tumor , virgolini et al label vip28 with iodine-123 ( 123i ) ( t1 / @card@ @card@ h , = @card@ kev , @card@ % ) at tyrosine position @card@ and @card@ [ @card@ ] . take into consideration , the ubiquitous availability , and its predominant world wide role in nuclear medicine , we label vip28 and pacap27 with 99mtechnetium ( 99mtc , t1 / @card@ @card@ h , = @card@ kev , @card@ % ) which require modification of the peptide to covalently accommodate a group of additional amino acid to chelate 99mtc [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . the use of 99mtc analogue allow efficient imaging of human breast cancer [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] .
positron emission tomography ( pet ) permit high imaging resolution lead to the visualization of small tumor ( @card@ mm. ) . pet imaging of tumor with 18flourine ( 18f ) label vip have not be highly appeal [ @card@ ] . for pet imaging , our goal be to label vip and pacap analogue with another radionuclide , namely 64copper ( 64cu ) . this radionuclide have a longer half life ( t1 / @card@ @card@ h , + = @card@ kev , @card@ % , = @card@ kev , @card@ % ) , be available commercially , have abundantly know chemistry and provide nearly quantitative yield so that label compound once prepare , can be inject without further purification .
in an attempt to develop vip28 analogue with high receptor affinity and good in vivo stability , Bolin et al [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] have synthesize and characterize several analogue of vip28 molecule . base upon these datum we choose two good additional vip28 analogue , make a total of four . to enable label with 64cu , each of the four peptide be further derivatized as describe in the material and method section .
the purpose of this investigation be to evaluate these analogue to ascertain that their biological activity and receptor specificity be not compromise as compare to those of the vip28 and to determine their suitability for pet imaging of human breast cancer .
