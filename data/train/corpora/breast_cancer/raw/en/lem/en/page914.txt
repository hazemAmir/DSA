treatment option for patient with advanced breast cancer be many and varied and include endocrine therapy , chemotherapy and novel targeted therapy such as trastuzumab . [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] patient may also receive investigational agent in the context of clinical trial at the discretion of their physician . treatment choice depend on patient age , menopausal status and disease characteristic . endocrine therapy be usually the treatment of choice for patient with potentially hormone-sensitive disease and include aromatase inhibitor ( ai ; anastrozole , letrozole and exemestane ) , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] anti-oestrogens ( tamoxifen and the new oestrogen receptor [ er ] antagonist , fulvestrant ) [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] and luteinising hormone release hormone agonists.9 mono- or polychemotherapy provide the mainstay of treatment for patient with hormone receptor-negative tumour as well as for those with very aggressive disease or whose tumour no longer respond to endocrine therapy . [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ]
over the past @card@ year , treatment strategy for hormone-sensitive early breast cancer have change dramatically , with tamoxifen be supersede by ai , @card@ and the introduction of other novel agents.11 in contrast to the early breast cancer setting where well-established consensus guideline be available , @card@ uniform guideline for the management of patient with advanced disease be currently lack . guideline can be an important tool in treatment decision make , but those currently available for advanced breast cancer vary geographically , and may not adequately address specific patient group . [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] the change in clinical practice in the early disease setting and the lack of uniform guideline have raise question about optimal treatment strategy for patient who subsequently develop advanced disease . for now , physician and patient must jointly explore and select the most appropriate therapy from the complex array of option available .
aim of this study
the primary aim of this study be to establish the level of need among breast cancer physician for the development of new advanced breast cancer treatment guideline . secondary aim be : to assess the impact of disease recurrence on both physician and patient ; to gain understanding of the goal of treatment and the factor influence physician in their treatment decision for patient with advanced breast cancer ; to gain understanding of the information source utilise and the role of current treatment guideline in the decision-making process ; and to gain insight into potential area of improvement for exist guideline .
method
an internet-based survey be conduct between @card@ and @card@ February @ord@ breast cancer physician be direct to the survey via the European school of oncology ( eso ) website . response be analyse after approximately @card@ physician have complete the survey . a copy of the survey use in this study be include in the supplementary material .
survey respondent and their patient with breast cancer
survey respondent state that they be fully qualify physician treat patient with breast cancer . respondent be then ask to confirm the country / region in which they be base and the specialist role ( S ) they have in the management of patient with breast cancer .
it be also ascertain how many patient with breast cancer each physician see over the course of a usual year and the proportion of these patient who have early ( stage @card@ / @card@ ) or advanced ( stage @card@ / @card@ ) disease .
the emotional impact of disease recurrence
physician be ask to think about their patient who have recently progress from early- to advanced-stage breast cancer . they be then ask to consider whether these patient be less , about the same or more distressed at progression than when they be newly diagnose with early disease . again just consider these patient , physician be ask whether they themselves be less , about the same or more distressed than when their patient have be diagnose with early disease . for both question they be also ask to provide detail as to why the emotional impact be less or more ( as appropriate ) .
from this stage onwards , the survey ask physician to think specifically about patient who have recently progress from early- to advanced-stage breast cancer .
treatment goal and factor influence treatment decision for patient with advanced breast cancer
in the next section , physician be ask to rate a list of potential treatment goal for these patient . option include : improve overall survival , delay disease progression , improve quality of life , achieve a response and other ( physician be ask to specify ) .
information source utilise by physician to support their treatment decision for patient with advanced breast cancer
physician be ask to rate a list of patient factor that may play a role in the treatment decision they make for these patient . factor include the patient ' S : age , menopausal status , treatment history , er status , human epidermal growth factor receptor @card@ ( her2 ) status , performance status , size of tumour , degree of nodal involvement , number of metastasis , site of metastasis , comorbidities , psychological state , social circumstance and distance from hospital .
physician be then ask to rate a list of treatment factor that may play a role in their decision . factor include the treatment ' S : efficacy , side effect , contraindication , cost , ease of use , formulation / administration , need for hospitalisation , their own personal experience and whether it be endorse by guideline or use as part of a hospital ' S policy . for each question , they could also specify up to three additional factor .
role of guideline in the treatment of advanced breast cancer
physician be ask to rate how often they use various information source to aid treatment decision for these patient . source include : work colleague , opinion leader , medical conference , medical press , lie press , treatment guideline , sale representative , text book , the Internet and patient . they be also give the option of include and rate up to three additional information source .
physician state that they never ' use guideline be ask if they be aware of any treatment guideline for patient with advanced breast cancer and to list any that they have hear of . they be also ask to give reason why they do not use any of these guideline . if the physician frequently ' or occasionally ' use treatment guideline , they be ask to name the guideline that they use . all physician except those state that they never use guideline be ask whether or not they agree with a list of reason why guideline could be useful . those state that they do not currently use guideline but who think that they may be useful , be also ask about the importance of the follow reason . the list of reason why guideline could be useful include : to confirm their treatment decision , to keep them aware of new drug , to keep them aware of new clinical datum , to keep them aware of new combination / sequence / dose regimen , to reassure them , to reassure their patient , to justify their approach to payer , to remind them of the available option , to prompt further patient evaluation and to protect them from legal action .
potential improvement to existing treatment guideline
physician who frequently ' or occasionally ' use treatment guideline be also ask to rate the importance of a list of potential improvement to existing guideline . potential improvement to guideline include : be update more frequently , be more specific for particular group of patient , include more clinical datum , include good summary page , be endorse by recognise international opinion leader , be endorse by cancer organisation such as eso and be easy to find . they be also give the option to list any other improvement that they would recommend .
result survey respondent and their patient with breast cancer
in total , @card@ questionnaire be complete . more than half ( @card@ % ) of respondent be European , @card@ % be from Asia and @card@ % from south america , with the remainder be split between north america ( @card@ % ) , Africa ( @card@ % ) and australasia ( @card@ % ) . respondent encompass all area of medical personnel involve in the treatment of breast cancer , include surgeon , oncologist and radiologist ( fig . 1 ) . just over one-third ( @card@ % ) of respondent state that more than @card@ % of their patient be be treat for breast cancer , while overall approximately @card@ % of breast cancer patient be treat have advanced disease .

the emotional impact of disease recurrence
the result of the survey show that disappointment / distress level be great at first recurrence than at first diagnosis of early breast cancer for @card@ % of physician and @card@ % of their patient . it be state as be about the same for @card@ % of physician and @card@ % of patient , with only @card@ % and @card@ % , respectively , state that distress level be less than at first diagnosis of early breast cancer . these datum indicate that both physician and patient find first recurrence distressing and difficult . the main reason give by physician as to why they find recurrence more disappointing than first diagnosis be : - it raise question over the first treatment they prescribedwas it adequate ? have they let the patient down ?
- it result in a feeling of personal failure .
- disease be now incurable .
- there be few treatment option available to offer your patient .
- it be difficult to tell patient that their disease have recur .
- physician have develop a close relationship with their patient by this stage .
for the physician who find it less disappointing than first diagnosis the main reason be that recurrence have always be acknowledge as a possibility .
there be similarity in the main reason give by physician as to why their patient find this event more distressing than first diagnosis , these include : - the knowledge that there be now no cure .
- the fear of death , particularly as they perceive death from cancer as be very unpleasant .
- the patient ' s confidence in both their physician and treatment be shake and may lead to distrust in both .
- they expect to be cure of early breast cancer and so recurrence be a shock and cause feeling of disappointment and anxiety .
- the patient may develop depression .
- the patient fear the next treatment ( e.g. . because of bad side effect , poor quality of life and no possible cure ) .
for the physician who say that their patient find it less distressing than first diagnosis , the main reason give be that some patient be not tell about the recurrence , some have already accept that they have cancer and some patient will have already be tell to expect recurrence .
treatment goal and factor influence treatment decision for patient with advanced breast cancer
at this stage of the disease , the goal of the treat physician be to improve the patient ' s quality of life , delay the progression of the disease and to improve overall survival ( fig . 2 ) . treatment decision therefore centre on efficacy ( @card@ % of respondent ) , potential side effect ( @card@ % ) , er status ( @card@ % ) , site of metastasis ( @card@ % ) , contraindication ( @card@ % ) and her2 status ( @card@ % ) ( table @card@ ) . in addition , @card@ % of respond physician state that it be important that treatment be endorse by guideline ( table @card@ ) .

information source utilise by physician to support their treatment decision for patient with advanced breast cancer and the role of guideline
most respondent use the currently available treatment guideline frequently ( @card@ % ) or occasionally ( @card@ % ) ( table @card@ ) . other key source of information be medical conference ( @card@ % ) , the Internet ( @card@ % ) and the medical press ( @card@ % ) . the most commonly use guideline include formal publication ( e.g. . national comprehensive cancer network [ nccn ] guideline ) and publication from specific meeting ( e.g. . American society of clinical oncology [ asco ] , st gallen and san antonio breast cancer symposium [ sabcs ] ) . these be primarily use as reminder of the available option ( @card@ % ) and to confirm a treatment decision ( @card@ % ) ( fig . 3 ) .

discussion and conclusion
the result of this survey suggest that the degree of emotional impact on both breast cancer physician and patient at the time of first recurrence be great than at first diagnosis . our result suggest that this be due to both the emotional impact of recurrence itself as well as the dilemma physician face regard how to choose the most appropriate treatment for patient with advanced breast cancer . that level of distress be great for both party at this stage be perhaps unsurprise , because for patient in this situation our survey suggest that recurrence mean death , while for physician recurrence imply failure . on both side , question be likely to be raise about the adequacy and efficacy of previous treatment and confidence in the physician and future therapy may be reduce .
in line with previous report , the result of this survey highlight that the treatment goal for the physician treat patient with advanced breast cancer be to improve quality of life , while extend overall survival.17 this point , along with those raise above , suggest that great effort should be make to research treatment option for patient with advanced breast cancer and that the result of such trial should be disseminate effectively , perhaps through the use of guideline . in addition , the use of new technology , such as interactive computer program and e-mail update , may help ensure that physician be fully able to make appropriate and informed decision regard the optimum treatment strategy for their patient with advanced breast cancer .
this survey show that treatment guideline be a key source of information support the treatment decision make for patient with advanced breast cancer , rank alongside medical conference , the Internet and the medical press . approximately half of the survey respondent also list patient as a source of information . this may in part reflect the fact that patient with breast cancer be often very well inform of the available treatment option and thus may have great involvement in the treatment decision-making process than other patient group . the fact that patient-centred care have be show to affect treatment adherence may also have influence responses.18 while some advanced breast cancer guideline be currently available ( include both formal nccn publication and regional guideline ) , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] these be limit in their scope and be less consistent than those available for early breast cancer . respondent in this survey feel that improvement could be make through the development of uniform , global guideline for advanced breast cancer detail treatment recommendation for specific patient group . although there be limitation to any survey base on a relatively small sample size due to the response and interpretation of the question be potentially subjective , it appear that these result be in line with current thinking in the field . indeed , since the time of this survey , effort have be initiate by the eso together with the European breast cancer conference to produce global metastatic breast cancer ( mbc ) guideline through the creation of the eso-mbc task force.20 an initial set of @card@ recommendation for the management of patient with mbc have now be published.21 interestingly this article reaffirm the notion that the treatment of mbc be consider an art , as there be few approve standard of care , particularly after first-line treatment have fail . encouragingly , the factor affect treatment choice view as important in the current survey be broadly in agreement with those include in the current eso-mbc recommendation . the result of the present survey reinforce the importance of this initiative and the development of more detailed guideline from the task force be await with interest .
