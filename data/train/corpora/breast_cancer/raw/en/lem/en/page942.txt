for more than a decade now , evidence-based decision-making have be a major trend in healthcare . rather than rely on unsystematic clinical experience , healthcare professional be encourage to base their clinical decision-making on the finding of scientific study [ @card@ ] . the evidence ' in evidence-based decision-making be usually understand to be empirically base , with the finding of randomize clinical trial ( rcts ) be consider one of the most robust form of evidence [ @card@ ] because it have the most objective way of eliminate bias . however , other form of evidence , where bias be more difficult to control ( e.g. . observational or case study ) , may be more appropriate for answer certain kind of research question . regardless of what research design be use , careful , systematic scientific scrutiny be use to determine effective diagnostic procedure and treatment . optimal patient care be then limit to these practice in order to minimize unnecessary treatment and control cost [ @card@ ] .
while there be an expectation that healthcare provider will incorporate evidence into decision-making involve patient treatment , until relatively recently , there be no such expectation of the patient themselves . in the past , treatment decision be entrust to the professional healthcare provider [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . more recently , trend within healthcare be transform the patient role in treatment decision-making from one of passive recipient , to one of more equal partner [ @card@ ] . an increase in consumerism , ' an expansion in the number of viable treatment option available , and the exponential growth of the Internet and availability of health information have all contribute to great patient involvement in healthcare decision [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] .
evidence-informed patient choice ( eipc ) be a concept that be root in the principle of informed choice [ @card@ ] . in order to uphold the principle , healthcare provider be obligate to ensure that patient be reasonably inform of the risk and benefit of a procedure prior to the patient give or withhold consent , and be afford the opportunity to have their concern and question address [ @card@ ] . scientific study determine the risk and benefit of different avenue of treatment ( or non-treatment ) . in order for patient to be inform regard treatment choice , they require a reasonable understanding of both the advantage and disadvantage of available treatment .
there be increase opportunity for oncology patient in particular to become involve in decision-making because of the variety of therapeutic option that be available for different cancer . most oncology patient want to be involve in decision-making and attain their preferred role in decision-making lead to good quality of life [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . despite this , patient do not always assume their preferred role in decision-making [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . not all cancer patient wish to be involve in decision-making , despite have more opportunity to do so . several study have report that the degree to which patient wish to participate in decision-making vary widely [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] , and that a patient ' s level of involvement in decision-making be not indicative of their desire for information . many patient who undertake a passive role in decision-making still want to be well inform . increase in knowledge , satisfaction , treatment compliance , and quality of life have be report as positive outcome of adequate information provision [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . not have enough information have be link to dissatisfaction with care and reduced well-being [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] .
investigator have find that the desire for information be temporal in nature , with different kind of information be request at different time throughout the disease trajectory [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . generally , the information cancer patient say that they require most be the information about survival and staging of the disease , and about treatment option and related side effect [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . while the literature widely refer to the desire for information exhibit by a patient as information need , we acknowledge that the term need ' inappropriately describe what be occur . use the term need ' imply that there be an objective standard by which the need can be assess . what be actually be determine be the patient ' express desire for information . for the sake of simplicity , however , we will use the term need in order to be in agreement with the existing literature .
overwhelmingly , healthcare practitioner be the most widely use and the most preferred source of information for cancer patient [ @card@ ] , although there be evidence that the use of electronic and medium source for cancer information have increase significantly [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . patient may also use specially design intervention call consumer decision aid ( cdas ) that provide information relevant to a specific decision regard treatment option . cdas , use prior to or during a physician consultation , be one way of engaging patient in a meaningful discussion of their treatment option . in addition to provide relevant information , the patient be lead through the decision process . risk and benefit of the treatment option be present in a format that be easy to understand along with a value clarification exercise mean to elicit the patient ' s personal preference regard different treatment option . cdas be an increasingly common method of support a treatment choice and be often use to facilitate the decision process . however , not all patient may have access to or choose to use decision aid prior to make a treatment choice .
pierce [ @card@ ] study the unaided decision-making process in woman with a diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer or a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease and find several problematic aspect of decision behaviour . decision aid be design , in part , to counteract faulty decision behavior . pierce also assert that the majority of woman in her study make satisfactory decision without the benefit of a decision aid . this unaided decision must be base on some type of information or evidence ' . as be mention previously , healthcare practitioner be the most preferred source of information for patient face a treatment choice ; however , other source such as family , friend , the medium , and the Internet be also widely use . researcher examine the source use by breast cancer patient have report inconsistent result , with some investigator report that people ' source be favor over documentary source [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] and other report the reverse [ @card@ ] .
other factor may come into play when patient make decision about which treatment to choose other than the simple provision of information . researcher examine how decision be actually make in the real world ( descriptive theory ) rather than how they ought to be make ( normative theory ) have discover that people often make decision that do not appear to be rational . how a choice be frame ' [ @card@ ] , which outcome a patient value [ @card@ ] , and whether the patient have the ability or motivation to understand the intricacy of the scientific information [ @card@ ] may all play a role in how a decision be make . decisional heuristic , adaptive short-cuts ' in the decision process be use to make decision in complex situation where information may be incomplete or difficult to understand . also , the emotional impact of be diagnose with cancer may lead patient to base decision on fear rather than scientific evidence [ @card@ ] .
in term of theoretical research , two particularly informative model of how oncology patient seek out healthcare information exist in the literature . johnson [ @card@ ] produce the comprehensive model of information seek ( cmis ) which focus on characteristic and utility of information channel ( source ) as well as factor antecedent to information seek ( personal relevance and background factor ) . more recently , Longo [ @card@ ] develop a conceptual model , which identify several personal and contextual factor think to influence information seek and use ; factor that be roughly equivalent to Johnson ' s personal relevance and background factor . but instead of focus on the characteristic of the source , the longo model describe the actual process of information seek and information use . two kind of information use be identify : one result from active information seek and one resulting from the passive receipt of information . in each of these two category , several phase of information use be identify accord to the level of the patient ' S involvement . for example , in phase @card@ , the patient be not aware of or do not receive the available information . in phase @card@ , the patient be aware of the information but do not attempt to access it , or passively receive it and so on . Longo identify satisfaction , health outcome , activity of daily living ( adls ) , and empowerment / locus of control as relevant patient outcome .
conceptual model be helpful in identify key variable that be to be study , and can help in organize the finding of related research [ @card@ ] . evidence obtain from empirical research or systematic review of the existing literature either refute or confirm the model propose relationship , thus either challenge or strengthen the model . the ultimate goal be to produce the most accurate and parsimonious representation of the truth ' . the longo model be useful in that it synthesize and integrate the concept surround information seek and use by cancer patient , however , the relationship propose need to be test and refine . it be our intention to determine whether or not the influence factor and relationship present in the longo model be support by the existing literature . in order to resolve this , we have seek out empirical article that explore the way in which breast cancer patient ' s acquire and utilize information for treatment decision-making .
in this paper , the author survey the existing literature relate to the express information need of early-stage breast cancer patient face a treatment choice between mastectomy and lumpectomy , the information source use to satisfy these need , and the outcome relate to decisional support intervention . specifically , we summarize research relate to the follow question : question @card@ : what be the various express information need of early-stage breast cancer patient ( in term of type , range , quality , and quantity ) and what source of information be use to fill these various need within the context of a treatment decision between mastectomy or lumpectomy ?
question @card@ : what effect do woman identify as a result of use research evidence , specifically decision aid use to support a treatment decision between mastectomy and lumpectomy ?
@ord@ method
broadly speak , the aim of a systematic review be to synthesize the finding of several study that address the same topic or problem , use strategy that limit bias and random error . study be put through a rigorous critical appraisal process and finding be combine and interpret [ @card@ ] . when finding be too diverse to be compare statistically or when the research method use be dissimilar , a more narrative approach must be undertake . the research question guide this review cast a broad net into the literature result in the capture of a diverse set of study . it be evident early in our process that an integrative review be a more appropriate strategy to assimilate the finding . integrative review allow for the inclusion of a diversity of literature , both empirical and theoretical and can contribute to a comprehensive portrayal of the topic of interest [ @card@ , page @card@ ] .

the next great desire be for treatment information . while have information available to help in decision-making be important , it be not the only reason for satisfy an information need , as be report in the article by henman et al .

age and the type of surgery choose be find to influence source choice ( table @card@ ) . finding from one of the study that use qualitative method include two theme that be consistent with what the quantitative study find : trust in the advice and opinion of physician about treatment decision , and appreciate the importance of support from family and friend in decision-making [ @card@ ] . both theme support the notion that interactive human ' source of information be preferred over static paper-based ' or electronic source .
@card@ . decision aid study
while there be several well-known evaluative study of decisional support intervention that include a mixture of decision aid [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] ( in term of purpose , patient population , or diagnosis ) , there be only six study that focus on woman make the treatment choice between lumpectomy or mastectomy [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] .
quantitative finding be equivocal . statistically significant difference be find between intervention and control group in some study , while other study find no difference ( table @card@ ) . qualitative finding be more definitive . patient appreciate the clarity of information , the use of diagram and picture , and the fact that information that the physician provide be reinforce . overall , both patient and physician reaction to the intervention be positive .

@card@ . methodological rigor
the disparate nature of the research method use among the include article preclude any systematic quality assessment from be perform . article use similar method be group together for a narrative assessment of research rigor . the most common research design use to investigate information need and source be a descriptive cross-sectional design . method of datum collection include self-report questionnaire , card-sorts , and interview ( both individual and focus group ) . questionnaire about source use / preference and information need be able to elicit the degree of use or preference by use a likert-like scale . however , a ceiling ' effect be note especially in the information need study , with patient designate every kind of information as be important . the card-sort technique use in four of the study eliminate this problem and allow information need to be measure relative to each other .
the use of consecutive and convenience sampling in the quantitative study , while understandable give the difficulty in randomize patient and the vulnerability of the population under study , do introduce potential sampling bias . sample use in the majority of study be predominantly white , well-educated , middleclass woman . attempt to attain a more balanced sample by use quota sampling for example , may have lead to a more representative sample , and therefore , to a great ability to generalize to the population at large . the one study that focus on ethnicity [ @card@ ] do find some subtle difference in source use ( high % use of written material ) suggest that more heterogeneous sampling may produce slightly different result . purposive sampling be use for the qualitative study , which be entirely appropriate give that the goal of this kind of sampling be to ensure that those informant with a special knowledge ' of a phenomenon be choose .
another factor , the time between diagnosis and data collection , vary substantially among the study . anywhere from @card@ ' ( i.e. . at the time of diagnosis ) to @card@ month pass between the diagnostic consultation and data collection make recall bias a considerable threat . give that information need be find to change over time in one study [ @card@ ] , it be quite likely that information need at @card@ month post-diagnosis will not be comparable to information need at time of diagnosis . none of the study examine source use over time .
datum analysis consist of either simple reporting of frequency / ranking or the use of various statistical method to determine if difference in ranking accord to a specific variable ( age , education , choice of surgery , degree of decisional control , etc . ) be statistically significant . all the analysis be do at the individual level . article report the result of decisional support intervention use various experimental and quasi-experimental design to determine the effectiveness of different decision aid . three of the article report on the development and pilot testing of decisional support tool [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] . two of the study [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] use a randomize controlled trial design ( cluster randomization with physician randomize ) and , one study [ @card@ ] use a pre-test / post-test longitudinal design with data collection occur at three point . control ' group receive either the usual ' practice or a significantly scale down version of the decisional support intervention . statistical test use to determine if difference between group be statistically significant be the t-test , chi-square test , and manova . power calculation be report for all three of the study that be not pilot . one of the three non-pilot study be underpower [ @card@ ] .
in summary , the information need and the source access to satisfy these need have be explore in several study , but mainly on a descriptive level . additionally , the sampling method use in these study may limit the generalizability of the result . the study that examine decision aid outcome , while methodologically more rigorous , find only very modest difference between the intervention group and the usual practice ' .
@ord@ discussion and conclusion4.1 . discussion
this review focus on the information need identify by early-stage breast cancer patient in the context of make a treatment choice and the source of information they access to satisfy those need . investigator have conduct systematic review of the literature examine the information and support need of breast cancer patient [ @card@ ] and cancer patient in general [ @card@ ] , but none have focus specifically on information need in the context of make a treatment choice . only one systematic review of the source of information use by cancer patient could be locate [ @card@ ] . one review [ @card@ ] examine information need and source use in tandem . systematic review of decisional support intervention for cancer treatment decision-making exist [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] , however , none be restrict to examine the use of consumer decision aid ( cdas ) with breast cancer patient specifically . this review then , be unique in that it link together these three different but related aspect of information seek behavior , and examine them within the context of a specific patient population at a particular juncture of their disease trajectory .
base on this review , the relationship between information need , information source , and decisional support can be describe in the follow way . most , but not all patient wish to be involve in treatment decision-making [ @card@ ] . those who take part in plan their treatment need to base decision on some sort of information . this requirement for information be express as an information need . how this need be satisfy determine the source access . cdas be intervention design by healthcare professional to help patient and their physician choose among two or more sound clinical option [ @card@ ] . however , patient may not be aware of , have access to , or have the desire or need to use a cda . a decisional support intervention be only one of any number of information source on which a patient may base her treatment decision . as well , several factor such as age , education , and health status may influence which information need have priority and which information source be access .
@card@ . information need
the overall ranking of information need be fairly consistent with chance for a cure ' and stage of disease ' take precedence over treatment information ' . this be not surprising since the question ( in most case ) be ask relatively close to the time of diagnosis . cancer be see as a threat to life and be able determine the extent of that threat would likely be a priority . information need be find to be influence by several factor , albeit not consistently , over the eight article review . age , education , time since diagnosis , and degree of participation in decision-making be all find to influence information need priority ranking . for example , old woman rank information about sexuality lower , and information about self-care high than young woman . this could be explain in a number of way . old woman be more likely to be single and therefore , may lack a sexual partner or they may have increase sexual dysfunction due to post-menopausal hormonal change [ @card@ ] . woman already cope with age-related functional change may be concern that disease-related change may threaten their ability to maintain independence . as a result , information need regard self-care take precedence over sexuality . an alternate explanation may be that old woman have more sexual experience to draw from than do young woman , and therefore , have few information need . another factor find to influence information need be time since diagnosis . information concern chance of a cure and stage of disease be the most important need for all breast cancer patient , but they take on a high priority closer to the time of diagnosis . this be not surprising , since the degree of threat and feeling of vulnerability would be heighten at the time of diagnosis and would dissipate somewhat over time [ @card@ ] .
@card@ . information source
the choice of source of information use by early-stage breast cancer patient to inform their treatment choice be consistent in that people ' source be rank high than medium or documentary source in almost all of the study , with physician be the most preferred / use source overall . the use of family and friend as an information resource be also a prevalent finding . patient appreciate human source of information for their interactive natureinformation could be tailor to their specific situation , misunderstanding could be rectify , question answer , and information gap fill . human source , however , differ in term of their knowledge domain . a physician , a nurse , and a family member would each have a different kind of expertise , but in the study examine here , they be not differentiate . it would be helpful to know what kind ' of information be be seek from family and friend , and what kind be be seek from health professional , and what the relative importance in the decision-making process each have .
factor find to be associate with the kind of source use be chiefly age , education , degree of involvement in decision-making , income , and eventual surgical choice . for example , old woman be find to be more satisfy with the information they receive from their physician , while young woman want more information and seek it out from a great variety of source . there be speculation that this be due to a change in attitude towards the medical profession , and that old patient would be more familiar or comfortable with a physician - patient relationship where the physician have a large decision-making role , and therefore , would trust that what information the doctor give them be good enough ' . income and education impacted source use in predictable way . in the two minority group study , high income be associate with computer ownership and consequently with the high ranking of web-based source . high education be associate with the use of medical journal in one study . as would be expect , the overall use of traditional research dissemination vehicle ( i.e. . peer-reviewed healthcare journal ) by patient be very low . for those patient with considerable education , however , it be a source that be access . more highly educate subject may have more positive attitude towards research and may be well able to understand and assess research finding .
@card@ . decision aid
the cda study examine in this review show mixed finding . some decrease decisional conflict and increase satisfaction with the decision and increase knowledge score . while qualitatively the comment regard the decision aid be very positive , quantitatively difference between the usual ' practice and the use of the cda be modest at good . this may suggest that woman be get the information they need from other source , or be get the information they need from their physician without have to use a cda . this be congruent with a finding from peirce ' s [ @card@ ] study ; that most woman be able to make a satisfactory decision regard their breast cancer treatment without the use of a decision aid .
@card@ . longo model
the author find that certain aspect of Longo ' S model be support by the finding of this integrative review . in the information need literature , the variable age and education ( demographic factor ' in the longo model ) , time since diagnosis ( delivery of care ) , and degree of participation in decision-making ( attitude , intention , behavior ) be find to influence the kind of information breast cancer patient desire . in the longo model [ @card@ ] , these variable and other be posit to influence information seek and use . the influence of factor ( in the longo model ) , such as culture , language , healthcare structure , etc. , on information seek and use be not support in the literature . either no significant statistical relationship have be find , or the influence of these factor on information seek and use be too difficult or expensive to measure . for example , the influence of healthcare structure on information seek would require a multi-national study involve countless participant and would likely be cost-prohibitive .
although information need be not the same as information seek and use , it could be argue that information need be a prerequisite for information seek . in order for active information seek to occur , a need must be perceive . it may be that the factor that influence the type , quality and / or quantity of information a patient require also influence how ( actively or passively ) a patient act to satisfy an information need . for example , a woman ' s high priority information need would be actively seek out , while a low priority need may be passively receive .
Longo mention health outcome , empowerment / locus of control , satisfaction , and adls as patient outcome that be affect by information seek behavior and information use . these variable be similar to the outcome that be measure in the cda study . while a cda be only one of many different source of information that could be use , the fact that they be find to significantly increase satisfaction ( with the information , the decision , and the decision process ) and improve health outcome support the relationship between information seek and use and patient / consumer outcome represent in the model . connection between information seek / use and locus of control / empowerment and activity of daily living be not support by the review literature .
one weakness of the longo model be that it do not address difference in choice of information source as it vary by personal ( e.g. . age ) or contextual ( e.g. . geographic proximity ) factor . the assumption be that one of the three type of source or channel ' ( use interchangeably here ) will be use , but there be no indication in the model that these channel may be influence by personal or contextual factor . in Johnson ' s comprehensive model of information seek [ @card@ ] , source characteristic and perceive source utility be see to influence source choice . in this review , age , education , degree of involvement in decision-making , and income be all find to be associate with source choice . incorporate the characteristic of the individual , the context and the source ( include utility ) into the model would strengthen it , and would help to explain the role that source choice have in affect outcome , such as satisfaction with the decision make .
we suggest that a more refined version of the model would provide great insight and understanding into the way in which consumer of health information determine what information be important , how that information be access , and how being the recipient of health information impact outcome such as satisfaction and well-being . the suggest relationship within the model that be not support in the literature need to test and develop . we suggest that further research be need to explore these interaction .
@card@ . implication for future research
while we be begin to understand what information be important to breast cancer patient , what source they use , and the role of cdas in provide information , many question regard information seek and information use be left unanswered . for example , why be some source preferred over other , what be the quality of these information source that make them attractive to patient , and be cdas the good way of provide the information patient need to make an informed healthcare decision ? additional research design to answer these and subsequent question will provide the insight require to refine a model of health information use by patient .
@card@ . conclusion
woman with early-stage breast cancer who be face surgical treatment for their disease express a desire for information about chance for a cure , the staging of their disease , and the available treatment . several factor influence this express desire include age , stage of disease , and whether they be active or passive participant in decision-making . the source prefer and access by these woman to satisfy these information need be overwhelmingly interactive human ' source , primarily in the study we have review , physician . age , education , and type of treatment choose influence the choice of information source . while qualitative finding support the use of cdas , the qualitative finding be more ambiguous . patient use decisional support intervention be find to have less decisional conflict , high satisfaction with the decision make and the decision process , and high knowledge level in some , but not all study . in relation to the considerable cost of produce decision aid , the benefit of use them be fairly meager .
@card@ . practice implication
for those make breast cancer treatment decision , we know that interactive human ' source of evidence be preferred and use far more than any other source , that treatment information be of high priority , and that many , but not all , patient want as much high quality information as possible . increase participation in healthcare decision-making by patient have necessitate the development of intervention that provide current , systematically derive research , thus ensure that healthcare decision can be make base on the good evidence ' . decision aid be not universally available , and when they be use , either by the patient themselves , or in conjunction with a healthcare professional , they produce limited benefit .
of course , trend in information need and source choice base on demographic characteristic do not imply that all member of a specific population hold similar preference . many author stress the need to assess information need on an individual basis . as well , assumption about source use should not be make . not all young patient be Internet savvy , and not all old patient think that their physician ' s opinion regard treatment be good enough ' . practitioner need to be aware of the trend ' , but not be limit by them .
further research in this area should focus on determine the reason certain source be use , and in what context . if interactive human ' source be preferred by patient , then by what mechanism ( s ) be they evaluate ? in addition , what role do traditional research ' play in patient decision-making ? a good understanding of the concept surround source use ( i.e. . a conceptual model ) would provide a solid foundation from which to create more effective way of disseminate information to patient that be essential for optimal decision-making .
