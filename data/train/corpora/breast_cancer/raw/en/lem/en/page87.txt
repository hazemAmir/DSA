cadmium ( cd ) be a heavy metal that be widely distribute throughout the environment as a result of pollution from a variety of source . the environmental exposure to cd occur through contaminated food and cigarette smoke . for the general population , tobacco smoking be an important source of cd exposure ( who / icps , @card@ ) . cd be classify as a category i carcinogen by the international agency for research on cancer ( iarc , @card@ ) . however , in comparison with the other carcinogenic metal , cd be not a strong cancer initiator and instead , it be a weak mutagen ( rossman et al. , @card@ ) . cd-induced stimulation of cellular signal at various stage of the mitogenic cascade , such as proto-oncogene expression , dna synthesis , and cell proliferation in various mammalian cell system , be think to be the mechanism for the carcinogenic action of this metal .
during the last decade , a grow body of evidence have accumulate suggest , that , in certain cell type , micromolar concentration of cd be able to initiate a series of rapid signal event include : generation of second massager ( ip3 , camp ) within @card@ - @card@ S ( [ smith et al. , @card@ ] and [ yamagami et al. , @card@ ] ) ; increase in intracellular calcium within @card@ min ( [ smith et al. , @card@ ] and [ yamagami et al. , @card@ ] ) ; activation of certain kinase ( [ hung et al. , @card@ ] , [ galan et al. , @card@ ] , [ misra et al. , @card@ ] and [ misra et al. , @card@ ] ) ; and induction of early response gene c-fos and c-myc within @card@ min ( [ beyersmann and hechtenberg , @card@ ] , [ misra et al. , @card@ ] and [ misra et al. , @card@ ] ) . since these signal be generate soon after cd exposure , it argue against a physiological interaction between cd and intracellular protein . it have be postulate that cd might bind to and activate a putative cell membrane receptor and trigger the downstream signal event . however , only a limited number of study ( [ misra et al. , @card@ ] and [ misra et al. , @card@ ] ) have explore this possibility , and there be no definitive study that elucidate the nature of the receptor that might possibly mediate this effect .
estrogen can modulate cellular function through non-genomic action which be initiate from the cell membrane . there be two propose model for the rapid response to estrogen action . the first model propose that the membrane-bound estrogen receptor alpha ( mer ) be associate with the cell membrane protein , include g protein and receptor tyrosine kinase , and mediate the rapid signal induce by estrogen ( [ razandi et al. , 2003a ] , [ razandi et al. , 2003b ] , [ razandi et al. , @card@ ] and [ pedram et al. , @card@ ] ) . the second model propose that another membrane g protein-coupled protein , gpr30 be involve in this process ( [ filardo et al. , @card@ ] , [ filardo et al. , @card@ ] , [ Norman et al. , @card@ ] , [ hewitt et al. , @card@ ] , [ revankar et al. , @card@ ] and [ thomas et al. , @card@ ] ) . although the nature of mer be still debate ( [ song and santen , @card@ ] and [ warner and gustafsson , @card@ ] ) , there be evidence that in certain cell type , a small fraction of er , that be associate with the cell membrane and originate from the same transcript of classical er , be require for rapid effect of estrogen ( [ razandi et al. , 2003a ] , [ razandi et al. , 2003b ] , [ razandi et al. , @card@ ] , [ song et al. , @card@ ] and [ pedram et al. , @card@ ] ) .
at relatively low dose ( @card@ - @card@ g / kg , ip ) , cd be able to increase uterine weight , promote growth and development of mammary gland , and induce hormone-regulated gene in ovariectomized rat ( johnson et al. , @card@ ) . as a xenoestrogen , cd have the ability to bind to er with high affinity ( kd = @card@ @card@ @card@ ) , and activate and alter estrogen target gene transcription and expression ( [ garcia-morales et al. , @card@ ] and [ stoica et al. , @card@ ] ) . if the non-genomic effect of 17-estradiol ( e2 ) be mediate by mer , it be conceivable that cd may also trigger a rapid signal cascade by the same mechanism .
mitogen activate protein kinase ( mapks ) be serine / threonine protein kinase that play important role in the signal cascade regulate cellular process such as cell proliferation , differentiation and apoptosis . three major subfamily have be describe : extracellular-regulated kinase ( erk ) , c-jun n-terminal kinase ( jnk ) , and p38 kinase . depend on the cellular context and stimulator , there be a significant cross talk between transduction module as they can respond to a common upstream activator and phosphorylate common down stream target . in general , the erk pathway be preferentially activate in response to growth and differentiation factor , while jnk and p38 kinase be more sensitive to stress stimulus include heat shock , inflammatory cytokines , ultraviolet and gamma irradiation , and hyperosmolarity ( roux and blenis , @card@ ) . the cell show different temporal and dose-response pattern to cd treatment in term of activation of mapks . among the three major subfamily of mapks , erk1 / @card@ be usually activate by cd much earlier than jnk and p38 kinase ( [ alam et al. , @card@ ] , [ Chuang et al. , @card@ ] , [ Chuang and Yang , @card@ ] , [ Huang et al. , @card@ ] and [ iryo et al. , @card@ ] ) . additionally , rapid activation of erk1 / @card@ be widely use as an endpoint to reflect e2-induced non-genomic effect in a variety of cell type ( [ filardo et al. , @card@ ] , [ filardo et al. , @card@ ] , [ razandi et al. , 2003a ] , [ razandi et al. , 2003b ] , [ razandi et al. , @card@ ] and [ pedram et al. , @card@ ] ) .
the activation of either erk1 / @card@ or akt , or both pro-survival kinase , could prevent cell from undergo apoptosis induce by certain chemical or physical agent . the serine / threonine protein kinase pi3k / akt be also activate by various growth and survival factor . akt promote cell survival through two distinct pathway : inhibition of apoptosis by phosphorylation of the bad component of the bad / bcl - xl complex , cause dissociation of the bad / bcl - xl complex and allow cell survival ; and activation of ikk that ultimately lead to nf-kb activation and cell survival ( hennessy et al. , @card@ ) . e2 can induce the activation of akt in endothelial cell from wild type mouse within @card@ min , but not in cell from er / er combined-deleted mouse ( pedram et al. , @card@ ) . Misra et al . ( @card@ ) report that in 1ln prostate cell akt be activate by @card@ m cd within @card@ min .
the present study be design to investigate rapid signal in response to cd in three human breast cancer cell line with different expression profile for er , er and gpr30 .

result activation of erk1 / @card@
the presence of phosphorylated threonine and tyrosine residue in mapk correlate with the activity of kinase . thus , to assess activate erk1 / @card@ level , the cell extract be process use western blot analysis use antibody against phosphorylated peptide encompass erk1 / @card@ residue . first , the time-course of cd-induced erk1 / @card@ activation be compare between the mcf-7 , mda-mb-231 , and sk-br-3 cell . e2 be use as a positive control and response pattern comparison be make between e2 ( @card@ nm ) and cd ( @card@ m ) . the effect of medium change on the erk1 / @card@ phosphorylation be examine in untreated mcf-7 cell and no significant change be observe ( datum not show ) . as depict in fig . 1a , b , g , and h , the temporal response pattern of erk1 / @card@ activation induce by cd in mcf-7 cell be similar to that induce by e2 . maximal erk1 / @card@ activation by both e2 and cd be observe at @card@ min follow by a gradual decrease over the @card@ min period . in contrast to the mcf-7 cell , neither cd nor e2 activate erk1 / @card@ in the mda-mb-231 cell that express only er ( fig . 1c , d , g , and h ) . however , in the sk-br-3 cell , that express only gpr30 , both cd and e2 cause transient activation of erk1 / @card@ ( fig . 1e , f , g , and h ) , similar to that observe in the mcf-7 cell . these result indicate that mer and gpr30 , but not er be important in cd-induced rapid signal of erk1 / @card@ .

effect of an estrogen antagonist on erk1 / @card@ and akt activation
since e2-induced rapid activation of erk1 / @card@ in mcf-7 cell be through mer , ici @card@ , @card@ , an estrogen antagonist , be able to antagonize both e2-induced genomic and non-genomic rapid signal effect . in the present study , the possible role of mer in cd-induced rapid signal be examine use the same antagonist . the quiescent mcf-7 cell be pretreated with @card@ m ici @card@ , @card@ for @card@ min , and then treat with @card@ m cd or @card@ nm e2 for @card@ min in the presence of the antagonist . the ici @card@ , @card@ stock solution ( @card@ mm. ) be prepare in ethanol , thus the control cell be incubate with medium contain @card@ % ethanol . as depict in fig . 5a - d , whereas the antagonist complete block the e2-induced phosphorylation of both kinase . it have no significant effect on the cd-induced phosphorylation of either kinase . lack of effect of cd-induced activation of erk1 / @card@ and akt by the receptor antagonist be contrary to all the other result obtain thus far and suggest an mer-independent mechanism .

effect of sirna against her on erk1 / @card@ activation
to further evaluate the role of mer in cd-induced rapid activation of erk1 / @card@ and akt , a second approach be utilize in which specific sirna be use to knockdown the expression of the receptor . transfection with her sirna markedly , but not completely , suppress the expression er in quiescent mcf-7 cell ( fig . 6a and b ) . this level of suppression of er expression be sufficient to completely block the e2-induced rapid activation of both erk1 / @card@ and akt ( fig . 6a - d ) . in comparison , it only partially blocked ( @card@ % ) the cd-induced activation of erk1 / @card@ ( fig . 6a and c ) , but completely block the activation of akt ( fig . 6b and d ) . these result suggest that , in addition to mer , other receptor might also be involve in interact with cd .

discussion
cd have be describe as an endocrine disrupt chemical by a number of investigator ( [ takiguchi and yoshihara , @card@ ] and [ henson and chedrese , @card@ ] ) . as a xenoestrogen , cd can alter the expression of certain estrogen target gene and affect breast tissue development in ovariectomized rat ( johnson et al. , @card@ ) . other metal , such as arsenic and uranium have also be evaluate for the reproductive tissue effect , but cd be the only one with demonstrate effect on mammary proliferation ( [ johnson et al. , @card@ ] and [ fenton , @card@ ] ) . although there be no definitive epidemiological evidence show a positive relationship between cd exposure and breast cancer incidence in the general population ( [ nagata et al. , @card@ ] and [ mcelroy et al. , @card@ ] ) , as a xenoestrogen , cd may play a role in cancer promotion and progression after the cancer be initiate ( [ brody and rudel , @card@ ] and [ yager and davidson , @card@ ] ) . the mechanism by which cd disrupt endocrine function remain poorly understand .
the result obtain in the present study demonstrate that in mcf-7 cell , a relatively benign breast cancer cell line , cd be able to rapidly activate erk1 / @card@ , akt and er at a micromolar concentration within @card@ min . under the same exposure condition , sk-br-3 cell , a moderately malignant breast cancer cell line , respond a bit more slowly ( @card@ min ) in term of erk1 / @card@ activation . in comparison , a highly invasive breast cancer cell line , mda-mb-231 , do not show a rapid response to cd treatment at all . from the dramatic response difference between these three cell line , it could be speculate that sensitivity to cd might be associate with the relative invasiveness of the breast cancer cell .
since activation of both erk1 / @card@ and akt play a role in regulate various cellular process such as cell growth , cell differentiation , and apoptosis induce by certain chemical or physical agent , more study need to be perform to further elucidate how cd-induced rapid signal affect the normal function of breast tissue and it ' s susceptibility to certain stress . in the present study , cd also induce rapid phosphorylation of er , which might make the cell more sensitive to relatively low level of e2 . although the downstream effect be not investigate in the present study , the result of erk1 / @card@ , akt and er phosphorylation suggest that even occasional exposure to cd might cause transient effect on the normal physiology of the breast tissue and might disrupt the normal homeostasis , especially if the exposure occur in early critical period of breast development ( Fenton , @card@ ) . the potential short-term exposure to low concentration of cd be of environmental health importance and may have biological significance , especially when the subject be co-exposed to other chemical or physical stress agent ( brody and rudel , @card@ ) .
the result present in this study also show that cd , like e2 , cause rapid phosphorylation of erk1 / @card@ in mcf-7 cell only @card@ min after treatment . this suggest that cd and e2 possibly share a similar downstream signal transduction pathway and regulatory mechanism . the rapid inactivation of erk1 / @card@ imply the existence of a tightly control regulatory mechanism . in contrast to these result , silva et al . ( @card@ ) report that @card@ m cd do not induce significant activation of erk1 / @card@ in mcf-7 bus cell during the @card@ - @card@ min treatment period . although the difference in biological characteristic and sensitivity to e2 and endocrine disruptor among various mcf-7 cell stock may partially contribute to the difference in cd-induced rapid activation of erk1 / @card@ ( villalobos et al. , @card@ ) , it be also possible that @card@ m cd be too low a concentration to detect any significant effect . in this regard , the present study provide a more comprehensive concentration-response datum about cd-induced rapid signal in the mcf-7 cell between @card@ and @card@ m concentration .
Alam et al . ( @card@ ) report increase phosphorylation of erk1 / @card@ in the mcf-7 cell in response to cd start at @card@ min and peak at @card@ h . they use mcf-7 n variant cell which could partly account for their result and those report in the present study ( burow et al. , @card@ ) . secondly , these investigator use dmem contain phenol red , and perform @card@ h serum starvation before exposure . the present study utilize phenol red-free dmem / f-12 medium and serum starve the cell for @card@ h . Matsuoka and igisu ( @card@ ) have show that without serum starvation , @card@ m cd induce significant phosphorylation of erk1 / @card@ in mcf-7 cell only after @card@ h of exposure . furthermore , because phenol-red be a weak estrogen mimic , it can interfere with the effect of estrogen . therefore , phenol-red should be exclude from the medium when study the effect of estrogen or endocrine disruptor . additionally , since erk1 / @card@ can be activate very rapidly , early time point need to be consider in design such study .
Guerra et al . ( @card@ ) observe that short treatment of septal murine cell ( sn56 ) with e2 cause a biphasic activation of erk1 / @card@ , with peak induction at @card@ - @card@ min in the early phase and @card@ h in the second phase . similarly , Marino et al . ( @card@ ) report that treatment of hepg2 cell with e2 also cause a biphasic phosphorylation of akt with peak at @card@ and @card@ min , respectively . furthermore , that the first wave of activation be er-independent , whereas the second be er-dependent .
brama et al . ( @card@ ) study cd-induced activation of erk1 / @card@ and akt in the mcf-7 cell and report maximum activation between @card@ and @card@ h . they conclude that this activation occur through an er-dependent mechanism , because it could be fully block by ici @card@ , @ord@ in comparison , in the present study , cd cause rapid activation of erk1 / @card@ at @card@ min in the mcf-7 cell and while it be not block by ici @card@ , @card@ , it be partially block in cell transfected with her . thus , cd like e2 appear to induce a biphasic activation of erk1 / @card@ and both the early and late phase possibly involve er .
besides the breast cancer cell , the activation of erk1 / @card@ by cd have be report in several other cell type , include human t lymphoblastoid ccrf-cem cell , non-small-cell lung carcinoma cell line cl3 , and mouse epidermal jb6 c141 cell ( [ iryo et al. , @card@ ] , [ Chuang et al. , @card@ ] , [ Chuang and Yang , @card@ ] and [ Huang et al. , @card@ ] ) . the phosphorylation of erk1 / @card@ in the ccrf-cem cell treat with @card@ m cd occur after @card@ min exposure ( iryo et al. , @card@ ) . in non-small-cell lung carcinoma cell line cl3 , high concentration of cd ( @card@ m ) induce phosphorylation of erk1 / @card@ after @card@ h of treatment ( Chuang et al. , @card@ ) . similarly , in mouse epidermal cell , Huang et al . ( @card@ ) report that @card@ m cd induce a sustained activation of erk1 / @card@ between @card@ min and @card@ h . Wang and Templeton ( @card@ ) report that erk1 / @card@ activation in rat mesangial cell be involve in cd-induced c-fos mrna transcription and that inhibition of erk1 / @card@ partially attenuate cd-induced c-fos transcription . thus different cell line show variation in response to cd-induced activation of erk1 / @card@ in term of time-course and concentration-dependence . it be likely that multiple mechanism be involve in mediate this effect and that certain biological response be cell type specific .
an important finding in this study be that the mda-mb-231 cell , that express only er , do not respond to cd , rule out the involvement of this receptor in cd signal . another membrane receptor , gpr30 , have be show to be involve in rapid e2 signal event ( [ filardo et al. , @card@ ] and [ filardo et al. , @card@ ] ) . since the skbr-3 cell contain gpr30 respond to cd , this receptor also appear to interact with cd .
in conclusion , the result present here provide evidence that micromolar concentration of cd rapidly activate erk1 / @card@ and akt in the mcf-7 and sk-br-3 cell . this process seem to involve mer and gpr30 . it be plausible that cd could also bind to other membrane receptor , upstream kinase or g-protein couple protein , which be associate with specialized cell membrane structural complex , such as caveolae , cause rapid activation of downstream kinase cascade ( [ wong et al. , @card@ ] and [ chini and parenti , @card@ ] ) . further study be need to elucidate the mechanism of cd-induced rapid signal and to well understand how cd interfere with the cell signal network , affect normal physiological function and homeostasis .
