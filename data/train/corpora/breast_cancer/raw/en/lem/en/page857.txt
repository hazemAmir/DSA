human prolactin ( hprl ) be a @card@ kda polypeptide hormone that be produce primarily by the anterior pituitary gland . the expression of hprl in the pituitary be regulate by multiple signal pathway mediate by epidermal growth factor ( egf ) , second messenger ca2+ and camp , and other hormone such as dopamine , thyrotropin-releasing hormone ( trh ) , thyroid hormone , estrogen and glucocorticoids ( [ baudhuin et al. , @card@ ] and [ freeman et al. , @card@ ] ) . as a pleiotropic and versatile hormone , prl exercise more than @card@ biological activity through bind to its cognate receptor ( [ bole-feysot et al. , @card@ ] and [ goffin et al. , @card@ ] ) . in human , the good know function of prl be to stimulate growth and development of the mammary gland ultimately lead to milk production and secretion ( [ horseman , @card@ ] , [ hovey et al. , @card@ ] , [ goffin et al. , @card@ ] and [ Grimm et al. , @card@ ] ) . mount evidence from cell culture and animal study as well as from epidemiological study ( [ hankinson et al. , @card@ ] , [ vonderhaar , @card@ ] , [ vonderhaar , @card@ ] , [ llovera et al. , 2000a ] , [ llovera et al. , 2000b ] , [ ben-jonathan et al. , @card@ ] and [ clevenger et al. , @card@ ] ) allow us to appreciate the contribution of hprl to the pathogenesis and progression of human breast cancer . however , anticancer therapy design to block expression and secretion of pituitary lactogenic hormone ( hprl and growth hormone ) have have little effect on patient with human breast cancer ( anderson et al. , @card@ ) . our research ( Ginsburg and Vonderhaar , @card@ ) as well as that of other ( [ clevenger et al. , @card@ ] , [ clevenger et al. , @card@ ] and [ ben-jonathan et al. , @card@ ] ) provide an explanation for this observation : local expression of hprl create an autocrine / paracrine loop within the human breast .
in addition to the mammary gland , prl be also produce locally by multiple other extrapituitary site , include the placenta , uterus , bone , prostate , brain and immune system ( [ ben-jonathan et al. , @card@ ] , [ freeman et al. , @card@ ] , [ clevenger et al. , @card@ ] and [ nevalainen et al. , @card@ ] ) . prl mrnas be detect in both normal and neoplastic human breast tissue as well as in human mammary cell line include mcf-7 , t47d , zr75-1 and mda-mb-468 derive from breast epithelial carcinoma ( [ clevenger et al. , @card@ ] , [ ginsburg and vonderhaar , @card@ ] , [ shaw-bruha et al. , @card@ ] and [ vonderhaar , @card@ ] ) . human prl protein be also detect in t47d cell and their er-negative derivative t47dco cell ( [ ben-jonathan et al. , @card@ ] and [ ginsburg and vonderhaar , @card@ ] ) . additionally , t47d cell contain both er and er ( [ vladusic et al. , @card@ ] and [ vonderhaar , @card@ ] ) make them excellent candidate for study on estrogen regulation of synthesis of hprl in breast cancer cell . that hprl antagonist block cultured mammary tumor cell growth further support the existence of an autocrine / paracrine loop ( [ fuh and well , @card@ ] , [ ginsburg and vonderhaar , @card@ ] and [ chen et al. , @card@ ] ) .
whereas mammary epithelium-derived prl may play a role in normal mammary development and human breast cancer progression , the regulation of hprl in mammary tissue and human breast cancer cell be not understand . extrapituitary prl expression be mainly regulate by a distal promoter locate @card@ kb upstream to the pituitary promoter ( [ berwaer et al. , @card@ ] and [ gellersen et al. , @card@ ] ) . as a result of alternative promoter usage , extrapituitary prl be regulate by different signal pathway and different hormone , cytokines or neuropeptides compare to regulation in the pituitary ( [ ben-jonathan et al. , @card@ ] and [ goffin et al. , @card@ ] ) . prl expression via the extrapituitary distal prl promoter have also be demonstrate in primary leukocytes and in leukemic cell line ( gerlo et al. , @card@ ) . it also have be report that the distal promoter be functional in many human breast cancer cell such as t47d , zr75-1 , mda-mb-231 and mda-mb-453 cell ( [ baudhuin et al. , @card@ ] and [ shaw-bruha et al. , @card@ ] ) .
here , we present evidence that estrogen directly induce hprl gene expression in er / er-positive t47d human breast cancer cell . we have identify a functional non-canonical estrogen responsive element ( ere ) and an ap1 site locate in the hprl distal promoter through which estradiol ( e2 ) act . gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay show that both er and er directly bind to the ere but only er interact with ap1 protein that bind to the ap1 site in the hprl distal promoter . promoter - reporter gene study demonstrate that both the ere and an ap1 site be require for full induction of the promoter activity by e2 . our study suggest that the interaction between estrogen , ers , the ere and ap1 transcription factor in regulation of autocrine / paracrine prl in the human breast may be critical for oncogenesis and may contribute to progression of breast cancer .

@card@ . both er and er mediate e2-induced hprl distal promoter activity
estrogen regulate gene expression through bind to cognate receptor . two subtype of er have be identify , er and er . therefore , we utilize er agonist and antagonist with different receptor specificity to examine effect on dprl-3000 promoter activity . while e2 and ici @card@ , @card@ have be identify as ligand for both er and er , ppt and mpp have be identify as specific ligand for er ( [ harris et al. , @card@ ] , [ stauffer et al. , @card@ ] and [ sun et al. , @card@ ] ) and genistein and dpn for er ( meyers et al. , @card@ ) . r , r-thc be a complete antagonist on er , but an agonist on er ( meyers et al. , @card@ ) . thus , the er- and er-specific agonist ppt , genistein and dpn induce dprl-3000-mediated luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner ( fig . 3a and c ) . the er-specific antagonist , mpp , completely block ppt induction of dprl-3000 promoter activity , but only partially inhibit e2-mediated induction of luciferase activity . in contrast , the pure antiestrogen ici @card@ , @card@ completely abolish e2- and dpn-induced activity ( fig . 3b and c ) . interestingly , r , r-thc itself induce dprl-3000-mediated luciferase activity , but it partially inhibit dpn-induced activity ( fig . 3c ) . these result suggest that both subtype of the er mediate estrogen ' s induction of dprl promoter activity in t47d cell . to further address this issue , we transiently transfected either er or er into an er-negative human breast cancer cell line , mda-mb-231 , along with dprl-3000 / luc and prl-tk . we find that while both wildtype er and er mediate e2 induction of the dprl promoter , the induction by e2 / er be to a lesser extent ( fig . 3d ) . the dna-binding domain deletion variant of er , er3 ( Bollig and miksicek , @card@ ) , also fail to fully induce the dprl promoter ( fig . 3d ) . these result show that while the e2 / er pathway be able to fully activate the hprl distal promoter , e2 / er and e2 / er3 pathway only confer partial activation suggest that multiple mechanism be involve , one of which do not require direct dna bind by the er .

@card@ . estrogen stimulation of dprl promoter activity through an ere and an ap1 site
upon bind to er and / or er , estrogen regulate gene expression through a variety of mechanism include genomic and non-genomic pathway . in order to elucidate which dna element ( S ) be responsible for e2 induction of dprl-3000 promoter activity , we perform computational analysis of the dprl-3000 promoter and prepare two deletion mutant ( fig . 4a ) . as show in fig . 4b , responsiveness of dprl-1504 / luc to e2 be similar to that of dprl-3000 / luc ; however , e2 do not elicit a response from the empty vector pgl2 or the proximal hprl promoter ( pit-3400 ) or from dprl-678 / luc . both ere and ap1 element can confer e2 responsiveness ( [ paech et al. , @card@ ] , [ jakacka et al. , @card@ ] , [ safe , @card@ ] and [ fujimoto et al. , @card@ ] ) . therefore , we introduce mutation in the ere and / or ap1 site and test for e2 responsiveness . as demonstrate in fig . 4c , while mutation in either the ere or ap1 site alone decrease e2 induction , significant induction of luciferase by e2 be still observe . however , mutation of both the ere and ap1 site completely abolish e2 induction . these result suggest that both ere and ap1 site present in the dprl promoter be responsible for e2 induction of hprl in t47d cell .

@card@ . both er and er bind the ere , but only er interact with the ap1 complex
comparison between the ere present in the dprl promoter and the consensus ere reveal that there be one base-pair mismatch ( fig . 5a ) . in order to investigate whether er and / or er bind to this non-canonical ere in the dprl promoter , we perform emsa with 32p-labelled ere sequence from the dprl promoter and chip assay . as show in fig . 5b , e2 treatment lead to formation of two complex on this ere that be compete away with unlabelled consensus ere or the ere from the dprl promoter , but not with a mutate ere . additionally , e2 treatment cause an increase in protein - dna complex formation in emsa with 32p-labelled ap1 sequence from the dprl promoter , which be compete away with unlabelled consensus ap1 oligonucleotide or the ap1 sequence from the dprl promoter , but not with a mutate ap1 site ( fig . 5c ) . by the chip assay , both er and er antibody pull down the ere fragment ( fig . 5d ) . however , only er as well as c-fos and c-jun antibody pull down the ap1-containing dna fragment ( fig . 5d ) . this suggest that both er and er bind to the ere present in the dprl promoter and that er , but not er , interact with the ap1 protein , c-fos and c-jun bind to the ap1 site present in the dprl promoter .

@ord@ discussion
the pituitary gland be once think to be the exclusive source of hprl . however , a variety of study have prove that hprl be also produce locally by several extrapituitary site , include notably the mammary gland ( [ ben-jonathan et al. , @card@ ] and [ freeman et al. , @card@ ] ) . prl mrnas have be detect in both normal and neoplastic human breast tissue as well as in human mammary cell line derive from breast epithelial carcinoma ( [ clevenger et al. , @card@ ] , [ ginsburg and vonderhaar , @card@ ] and [ shaw-bruha et al. , @card@ ] ) . increase evidence support the existence of an autocrine / paracrine loop in human breast tissue and cancer cell line ( [ fuh and well , @card@ ] , [ ginsburg and vonderhaar , @card@ ] and [ chen et al. , @card@ ] ) .
several study demonstrate that mammary-derived prl ( zinger et al. , @card@ ) might play a role in normal mammary development and human breast cancer progression underscore the importance of understand the regulation of its expression . extrapituitary prl expression be primarily regulate by a distal promoter ( [ berwaer et al. , @card@ ] and [ gellersen et al. , @card@ ] ) that be functional in human breast cancer cell such as t47d , zr75-1 , mda-mb-231 and mda-mb-453 ( baudhuin et al. , @card@ ) , as well as in primary leukocytes and in leukemic cell line ( gerlo et al. , @card@ ) . in contrast , manfroid et al . ( @card@ ) report egf stimulate the hprl pituitary promoter in human breast cancer sk-br-3 cell through its proximal ap1 responsive element . here , we present evidence that estrogen stimulate the hprl distal promoter in t47d human breast cancer cell through both ere and ap1 site .
estrogen , via its cognate receptor er and er , regulate gene expression through multiple mechanism . in the classical model , upon bind with e2 , dimerized er bind the specific dna element , ere and transactivates transcription of its target . recently , several alternative pathway have be describe that include response element to which the ers do not bind directly but rather result from interaction with other dna-bound transcriptional factor such as ap1 and sp1 ( [ paech et al. , @card@ ] , [ jakacka et al. , @card@ ] , [ safe , @card@ ] and [ fujimoto et al. , @card@ ] ) . several signal transduction cascade be activate by estrogen in various tissue and cell line ( levin , @card@ ) such as the estrogen upregulation of prl gene expression in pituitary cell via the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway ( watters et al. , @card@ ) . other kinase pathway that appear to be activate by estrogen include the pi3-k , pka and pkc pathway . after analysis of the hprl distal promoter , many potential dna responsive element be find that could be activate by estrogen . however , our deletion and mutation study demonstrate that only the promoter region include the ere and ap1 be responsive to estrogen and both ere and ap1 site be require for full induction of the promoter activity by e2 . Fujimoto and coworker ( Fujimoto et al. , @card@ ) report that environmental estrogenic chemical activate ap1 only through er , but not er , which be consistent with the work by paech et al . ( @card@ ) . consistent with these observation , we find that the e2 / er pathway confer a more robust induction of the hprl distal promoter than the e2 / er or the e2 / er3 pathway in mda-mb-231 cell ( fig . 3d ) . in the dna-protein interaction study , we find that both er and er bind to the ere present in the dprl promoter and that er , but not er , interact with the ap1 protein , c-fos and c-jun , bind to the ap1 site .
it be well document that e2 and ers play key role during breast development and carcinogenesis ( ali and commbes , @card@ ) . the identification of er and the presence of er variant such as er3 in human breast cancer cell make the process of gene regulation by estrogen even more complicated ( [ bollig and miksicek , @card@ ] and [ vladusic et al. , @card@ ] ) . mount evidence show that hprl and its cognate receptor ( prlr ) be implicate in development and progression of human breast cancer ( [ hankinson et al. , @card@ ] , [ vonderhaar , @card@ ] , [ llovera et al. , 2000b ] , [ ben-jonathan et al. , @card@ ] and [ clevenger et al. , @card@ ] ) . the complex interaction between prl and estrogen and their relationship to ap1 protein in human breast cancer have not be extensively address where human be expose with these hormone simultaneously . in addition to induction of autocrine / paracrine prl by e2 demonstrate herein , estrogen also stimulate prlr gene expression in human breast cancer cell ( [ lu et al. , @card@ ] and [ ormandy et al. , @card@ ] ) although the correlation between prlr and er be not consistent within the literature ( [ waseda et al. , @card@ ] , [ bonneterre et al. , @card@ ] , [ de Placido et al. , @card@ ] and [ ormandy et al. , @card@ ] ) . recently , dong et al . ( @card@ ) have report that estradiol up-regulates hprlr gene expression through a novel er-dependent transcriptional mechanism in which both c / ebp and sp1 / sp3 transcription factor be involve . moreover , a clinical study have show reduce expression of hprlr in a sub-group of breast tumor patient give tamoxifen ( de Castillo et al. , @card@ ) . the work from our laboratory and other have demonstrate that the expression of prl and prlr be find in more than @card@ % of female breast carcinoma and be high than that in normal breast tissue ( [ reynolds et al. , @card@ ] and [ trott et al. , @card@ ] ) . Gutzman et al . ( @card@ ) have report that the interaction between hprl and estrogen enhance the activity of ap1 in breast cancer cell through the mapk pathway . thus , the interaction among prl / prlr , estrogen and ap1 protein may cause a significant increase in the entire prl / prlr autocrine / paracrine system in breast cancer . additional study of cross-talk between prl and other pathway in human breast cancer cell will increase our understanding of the key interaction that occur during the development of this disease and potentially lead to improve treatment modality .
