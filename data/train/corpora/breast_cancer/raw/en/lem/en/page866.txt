the natural history of early breast cancer depend on both the nodal status and the biological characteristic of the primary tumour , such as oestrogen receptor ( er ) status . if the excise primary tumour have few oestrogen receptor ( Ie , be er-poor ) then the 5-year recurrence rate be high and hormonal therapy have little effect on it . [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] therefore , the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy be of particular interest . in advanced breast cancer , the effect of chemotherapy on macroscopic primary or secondary lesion can be observe directly and can be substantial . [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] in early disease , however , the effect of chemotherapy be not directly observable in individual patient , so trial be need . because any one trial of adjuvant chemotherapy can include too few patient with er-poor disease for statistical stability , the effect of this treatment on recurrence and mortality in such woman , especially in the long term , be well study by periodically update meta-analyses of all relevant randomise trial .
the early breast cancer trialists ' collaborative group ( ebctcg ) be set up in @card@ - @card@ to coordinate 5-yearly meta-analyses of centrally collect datum from woman in all randomise trial of the treatment of early breast cancer . the report from the @card@ ( second ) and @card@ ( third ) cycle of the collaboration indicate that , take all type of primary tumour together , the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on long-term outcome be , on average , great in woman young than @card@ year than at old age ( mainly @card@ - @card@ year , since few woman old than this have be study ) . [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] the report from the @card@ ( fourth ) cycle1 show that , at age @card@ - @card@ year , the effect of chemotherapy on mortality be , on average , somewhat great than have be indicate by the previous ebctcg report . it be , however , still difficult to determine reliably the effect in particular type of patient .
unless indicate otherwise , in the present report the term chemotherapy denote prolonged adjuvant treatment with various standard combination of old drug : eg , about six course of cmf ( @card@ % of randomise woman ) or about six course of fac or fec ( @card@ % of randomise woman ) ( where c = cyclophosphamide , m = methotrexate , f = 5-fluorouracil , a = doxorubicin [ also call adriamycin ] , and e = epirubicin ) . none of the regimen study be taxane-based or deliberately myeloablative .
various hypothesis have be raise about the efficacy of chemotherapy in er-negative breast cancer . in vitro study suggest that the presence of tamoxifen might reduce the uptake and cytotoxic activity of 5-fluorouracil and melphalan in er-negative breast cancer cell lines.12 an observational study on woman with advanced disease conclude that an objective response to chemotherapy be more likely in er-negative than in er-positive disease.3 but , late study do not replicate this finding and conclude either that the response to chemotherapy do not correlate with er-status , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] or even that it be increase by er-positivity . [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ]
a meta-analysis of the trial of single-cycle perioperative polychemotherapy ( pect ) versus no adjuvant treatment , @card@ include about @card@ patient ( @card@ with er-poor disease ) , indicate an effect on long-term survival that be less definite than in the trial of more prolonged polychemotherapy . these pect trial include both premenopausal and postmenopausal woman , irrespective of their er status , and do not give adjuvant tamoxifen . in one of the pect trial , however , recurrence be reduce only in the subgroup of @card@ postmenopausal woman who have er-poor disease . [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] in view of this , it be suggest that chemotherapy might be particularly effective in old woman with er-poor disease and no tamoxifen , and that the ebctcg analysis of prolonged chemotherapy should address this explicitly.16 it be therefore agree that the first report from the @card@ - @card@ ( fifth ) cycle should address the evidence regard the effect of adjuvant polychemotherapy versus no chemotherapy in er-poor disease , include not only the trial in which no tamoxifen be give but also those in which tamoxifen be give to woman in both group .
method
the method of seek collaboration and of data collection , collation , checking , and presentation be as in the previous ebctcg report.1 the ebctcg receive ethical approval from the Oxford research ethic committee . in the present cycle , trial be eligible if they begin by @card@ ( range of actual start date @card@ - @card@ ) and , for most of them , the late available follow-up information be resent to Oxford in @card@ - @ord@ analysis be by allocate treatment and , as previously , recurrence be define as the first detection after randomisation of any breast cancer ( local , contralateral , or distant ) . for the present ( @card@ - @card@ ) cycle , information be available on about @card@ @card@ woman with er-poor disease in trial of chemotherapy , tamoxifen , or both ( table ) . of these , about @card@ be in @card@ trial of polychemotherapy versus not ( chemotherapy alone versus no adjuvant therapy : about @card@ woman ; chemotherapy and tamoxifen versus tamoxifen alone : about @card@ woman ) and about @card@ @card@ be in @card@ trial of tamoxifen versus not ( mostly chemotherapy and tamoxifen versus the same chemotherapy alone ) .

forest plot in the accompanying webmaterial give separately , for each of these @card@ trial and for the four trial of perioperative polychemotherapy , a brief summary of the treatment regimen test and of whether the active treatment group be allocate both chemotherapy and tamoxifen , the number of woman with er-poor disease ( treatment versus control ) , and the main result in these woman . further detail of the trial and treatment regimen be give in the webappendix to the previous ebctcg report.1
in this report , er-poor tumour be define by receptor measurement do many year ago , and different technique be use in different trial ( or , sometimes , even in the same trial ) . they therefore include not only tumour with no er expression at all ( er-absent ) but also tumour with a little er expression ( @card@ femtomoles per mg cytosol protein , where quantitative measurement be available ) and , perhaps , some more strongly er-positive tumour with false negative receptor measurement .
statistical analysis
detailed description of the main statistical method have previously be publish , [ @card@ ] and [ @card@ ] and be also available online.17 logrank statistic be use to assess the effect ( active versus control ) on outcome , and to estimate ( by the one-step method ) event rate ratio and their confidence intervals.1 result for fine subdivision be plot as black square with horizontal line that denote @card@ % cis . the use of @card@ % rather than @card@ % cis be to help make some allowance for multiple testing . result for total and subtotal be plot as white diamond that denote @card@ % cis . to test for a trend between stratum ( eg , of age ) in the effect of treatment , suppose that stratum number S ( s = @card@ , @card@ ) have logrank statistic ( o - e ) and v ( with grand total over all stratum o - e and v ) . define m , the mean stratum number , to be the sum , one term per stratum , of sv / v , and define t to be the sum , one term per stratum , of ( s - m ) ( o - e ) @card@ the variance of t , var ( t ) , be then the sum , one term per stratum , of ( s - m ) @card@ / v . the trend test statistic ( Ie , the change from one stratum to the next in the log of the event rate ratio ) be then t / var ( t ) , which have variance @card@ / var ( t ) . test of whether two trend be the same involve subtraction of the corresponding trend test statistic from each other . a @card@ statistic on one degree of freedom ( @card@ ) for testing whether some quantity q differ significantly from zero be give by q2 / var ( q ) .
the follow two question be formally equivalent : ( 1 ) whether tamoxifen reduce the proportional efficacy of chemotherapy , and ( 2 ) whether chemotherapy reduce the proportional efficacy of tamoxifen . this can be illustrate by consider a hypothetical @card@ factorial trial of chemotherapy , tamoxifen , both , or neither . suppose that in one particular stratum ( of follow-up duration and of patient characteristic ) the event rate in the four treatment group be , respectively , chem , tam , both , and nil . two different chemotherapy comparison can be make , and then compare . for the efficacy of chemotherapy on its own , the rate ratio be a = chem / nil , and for the efficacy of chemotherapy in the presence of tamoxifen ( Ie , with tamoxifen in both group ) the rate ratio be b = both / tam . compare a and b to answer the first question , the value of b / a will tend to be less than @card@ if tamoxifen reduce the efficacy of chemotherapy . likewise , two different tamoxifen comparison can be make , and then compare . for the efficacy of tamoxifen on its own the rate ratio be c = tam / nil , and for the efficacy of tamoxifen in the presence of chemotherapy ( Ie , with chemotherapy in both group ) the rate ratio be d = both / chem . compare c and d to answer the second question , the value of d / c will tend to be less than @card@ if chemotherapy reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen . b / a be , however , identically equal to d / c , illustrate the equivalence in principle of question ( @card@ ) and ( 2 ) .

figure @ord@ polychemotherapy versus not in er-poor disease , by type of comparison ( absence or presence of tamoxifen in both treatment group ) and age at randomisation : 10-year probability of recurrence
view within article
for the trial of polychemotherapy versus not , the recurrence rate ratio be subdivide in figure @card@ and figure @card@ both by age when randomise ( entry age @card@ , @card@ - @card@ , or @card@ - @card@ year ; few be old than this ) and by the use of tamoxifen ( Ie , by the absence or presence of adjuvant tamoxifen in both of the treatment regimen be compare ) . in figure @card@ the analysis be subdivide first by the use of tamoxifen and then by age , whereas in figure @card@ the same analysis be subdivide first by age and then by the use of tamoxifen .
figure @card@ ( a ) describe the trial of polychemotherapy alone ( Ie , in the absence of tamoxifen ) , and suggest a substantial proportional risk reduction that be approximately independent of age ( although , if each age range be consider separately , then the confidence interval for the effect at age @card@ - @card@ and @card@ - @card@ year be both wide ) . by contrast , in the aggregate of all trial of polychemotherapy versus not ( section a+b in the low part of figure @card@ ) , the proportional risk reduction appear to be about twice as great at entry age less than @card@ as at entry age @card@ - @card@ , and there be a conventionally significant trend towards great efficacy of chemotherapy at young age ( treatment versus control recurrence rate ratio , @card@ [ se @card@ ] at entry age @card@ year and @card@ [ se @card@ ] at entry age @card@ - @card@ year ; test for trend of great effect at young age 2p = @card@ ) . this be because , in the presence of tamoxifen , there be a trend towards a great effect of chemotherapy at young age ( figure @card@ [ b ] ) . the apparent difference between the trend with age in figure @card@ ( a ) and @card@ ( b ) be , however , not conventionally significant ( 2p = @card@ ; footnote to figure @card@ ) . that be , the apparently null trend with age in figure @card@ ( a ) and the apparently strong trend with age in figure @card@ ( b ) be both compatible with the moderate trend with age in the overall result in figure @card@ ( a+b ) .
within each of the age range , of woman young than @card@ , @card@ - @card@ , and @card@ - @card@ year in figure @card@ , tamoxifen do not significantly modify the effect of chemotherapy . in the first two age range ( @card@ and @card@ - @card@ : figure @card@ [ a ] and @card@ [ b ] ) , chemotherapy appear somewhat more effective in the presence of tamoxifen , whereas in the third ( @card@ - @card@ : figure @card@ [ c ] ) it appear somewhat less effective in the presence of tamoxifen . in no age range , however , be these apparent difference in efficacy statistically significant ; nor be an overall age-stratified test of whether tamoxifen influence the efficacy of chemotherapy ( @card@ = @card@ , 2p = @card@ : figure @card@ ) .
although figure @card@ ( c ) could be take as evidence that tamoxifen reduce the efficacy of chemotherapy in woman age @card@ - @card@ , figure @card@ ( c ) provide evidence against this . for , in figure @card@ ( c ) , the effect of tamoxifen plus chemotherapy actually appear somewhat good than that of chemotherapy alone . this be the opposite of what would be expect if tamoxifen reduce the efficacy of chemotherapy . take together , the opposite interaction in figure @card@ and figure @card@ ( neither of which be statistically significant ) , suggest that tamoxifen be of little relevance to the efficacy of chemotherapy in er-poor disease . the statistical method section illustrate the equivalence of these two question .
the result for breast cancer mortality and death from any cause ( webfigures @card@ - 3 ) be similar to those for recurrence ( figure @card@ , figure @card@ and figure @card@ ) , except that the trend with age do not reach statistical significance . also , if the @card@ - @card@ age range be consider on its own then the mortality reduction in the trial of chemotherapy be not conventionally significant in the absence of tamoxifen , in the presence of tamoxifen , or in both combined ( age @card@ - @card@ only : overall relative risk @card@ [ se @card@ ] for breast cancer mortality and @card@ [ se @card@ ] for death from any cause : both 2p = @card@ ) .
figure @card@ show the 10-year recurrence risk for polychemotherapy versus not , subdivide as in figure @card@ and figure @card@ by age and by the use of tamoxifen , whereas figure @card@ show the corresponding 10-year result for death from any cause . the 10-year difference just in breast cancer mortality be similar to those in death from any cause ( webfigure @card@ ) .

in figure @card@ and figure @card@ ( as in figure @card@ ) the upper part ( a ) give the age-specific result in the absence of tamoxifen , the middle part ( b ) give the age-specific result in the presence of tamoxifen , and the low part ( a+b ) give the overall age-specific result . in no age range be the difference significant between ( a ) the absolute effect of chemotherapy in the absence of tamoxifen and ( b ) the absolute effect of chemotherapy in the presence of tamoxifen .
the overall result ( Ie , the low part ( a+b ) of figure @card@ , figure @card@ and figure @card@ ) be , of course , base on large number than ( a ) or ( b ) alone . even here information be available on only about @card@ woman in each of the three age range ( @card@ , @card@ - @card@ , and @card@ - @card@ year ) . this be still not enough for result in individual age range to be numerically stable , particularly for mortality in the old age range . thus , although the mortality reduction at age @card@ - @card@ be not conventionally significant on its own , it should be interpret in the context of the highly significant mortality reduction at age @card@ - @ord@ in assess the effect of chemotherapy in old woman , it might be appropriate to consider the datum in these two 10-year age range together , give the small number who be randomise .
the overall result ( a+b ) in this 20-year age range ( @card@ - @card@ ) and in young woman be give in figure @card@ ( and in webfigures @card@ and @card@ ) , which compare the finding for recurrence , breast cancer mortality , and death from any cause . in both age range ( @card@ and @card@ - @card@ year ) , the effect of chemotherapy on the 10-year probability of death from any cause be highly significant ( age @card@ year @card@ % vs @card@ % dead , absolute difference @card@ % [ se @card@ ] , 2p = @card@ ; age @card@ - @card@ year @card@ % vs @card@ % dead , absolute difference @card@ % [ se @card@ ] , 2p = @card@ ) . the effect on death from any cause be about the same as the effect on breast cancer mortality ( figure @card@ ) , suggest little effect of these regimen on 10-year non-breast-cancer mortality , even at @card@ - @card@ year of age .

in young woman ( @card@ year ) in these trial , @card@ % have node-negative disease and only @card@ % have node-positive disease , whereas @card@ % of those age @card@ - @card@ year have node-positive disease . recurrence rate be much high in node-positive than in node-negative woman but , despite this , neither the age-stratified nor the age-specific proportional risk reduction be significantly affect by nodal status ( age-stratified = @card@ [ 2p = @card@ ] ; age-specific = @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ [ 2p = @card@ , @card@ , and @card@ ] for age-group @card@ , @card@ - @card@ , and @card@ - @card@ , respectively ) . the corresponding result for breast cancer mortality and death from any cause be give in webfigure @card@ .
the three part of webfigure @card@ give further subgroup analysis with respect to type of chemotherapy , menopausal status ( stratify by age ) , nodal status ( stratify by age ) , use of tamoxifen ( in both treatment group ) , tumour size ( in all woman , and just in woman with node-negative disease ) , tumour differentiation ( in all woman , and just in woman with node-negative disease ) , and progesterone receptor status . none of these factor significantly modify the proportional risk reduction produce by chemotherapy . although the anthracycline-based fac or fec regimen appear somewhat more promising than old regimen such as cmf , more reliable evidence for this conclusion come from the much large number in the directly randomise comparison of such regimen versus cmf.1 webfigure @card@ also show that @card@ % of the recurrence be specify to be local or contralateral ( and some of the unspecified one could also have be local or contralateral ) ; that the proportional reduction in local and in distant recurrence be similar ; and that the main effect on recurrence be in just the first few year after randomisation , as already see in figure @card@ .
webfigure @card@ give the result separately for each of the @card@ trial of chemotherapy versus not , and webfigure @card@ give the result separately for each of the @card@ trial of tamoxifen versus not . for completeness , webfigure @card@ give the result separately for each of the four trial of a single course of peri-operative polychemotherapy versus no adjuvant chemotherapy .
discussion
a large amount of datum from previous trial be now available , and the present result show that long-term follow-up of such trial can continue to yield useful result . the effect of adjuvant polychemotherapy on recurrence and mortality be substantial , and statistically definite , both for woman with er-poor disease age less than @card@ and for those age @card@ - @card@ year ( figure @card@ ) . how should these finding inform the current and future care of such woman the chemotherapy be probably not give as intensively as it would be now , particularly in old woman , and none of the patient in the present analysis receive new drug such as taxanes . hence , current and future adjuvant regimen could well produce substantially great proportional risk reduction in recurrence and breast cancer mortality than the regimen test in these trial .
although tamoxifen would not now be use in er-negative disease , it be give to many of the woman in these trial . to estimate the absolute effect of chemotherapy on recurrence and mortality that would have be see in these trial if no tamoxifen have be use , two approach be possible . one be chiefly to emphasise just the upper part ( a ) of figure @card@ , figure @card@ and figure @card@ on the ground that these be the only chemotherapy comparison in which tamoxifen be not give . the other be chiefly to emphasise the overall result in the low part ( a+b ) of these figure , on the ground that , as tamoxifen be of little relevance to the effect of chemotherapy in er-poor disease , this be the totality of the randomise evidence compare chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy . the first approach have the advantage of simplicity , but it also have the disadvantage of small number of woman and hence large random error , particularly if the age range @card@ - @card@ year ( @card@ woman ) and @card@ - @card@ year ( only @card@ woman ) be consider in isolation from each other .
in the age range of less than @card@ and @card@ - @card@ year , the relative risk and the 10-year gain be similar in the upper part ( a ) and low part ( a+b ) of figure @card@ , figure @card@ and figure @card@ , so both approach would yield similar estimate of benefit , although the finding at age young than @card@ and @card@ - @card@ year be more highly significant with the large number in the low part ( a+b ) . in the age range @card@ - @card@ year there be independent evidence that tamoxifen do not directly or indirectly ( eg , by modify compliance ) reduce the efficacy of chemotherapy in this age range ( figure @card@ [ c ] ) . therefore , it might be more appropriate to emphasise all the randomise evidence ( part ( a+b ) ; @card@ woman ) rather than just a fraction of it ( part ( a ) ; @card@ woman ) .
in the overall result ( a+b ) , the mortality reduction be highly significant when the age range @card@ - @card@ and @card@ - @card@ year re combine , as in figure @ord@ this , together with the significant recurrence reduction in both age range ( see figure @card@ ) , indicate that there be an appreciable mortality reduction not only at age @card@ - @card@ but also at age @card@ - @card@ year , even though the reduction at this late age might be somewhat small . at present there be very little direct information on the benefit or hazard of chemotherapy in woman over the age of @card@ year , as few old woman be randomise in these trial .
at least a quarter of the recurrence be isolate local or contralateral recurrence , and the 10-year reduction in mortality be only about two-third as great as the 10-year reduction in recurrence ( figure @card@ ) . in both of the age range in figure @card@ ( @card@ and @card@ - @card@ year ) the absolute reduction in the 10-year risk of death from any cause be about as great as the reduction in breast cancer mortality , in line with other evidence that these chemotherapy regimen have , on average , little adverse effect on mortality from other cause during the first @card@ year after treatment.1
in consider the general implication of these trial result , it be appropriate to consider mortality from breast cancer and mortality from other cause separately . for breast cancer , the proportional risk reduction might well be more stable than the absolute risk reduction , as be the case with nodal status ( webfigure @card@ ) . they be , therefore , more likely to be widely generalisable . approximate proportional risk reduction can be obtain from the ratio , treatment versus control , of the 10-year breast cancer mortality risk in figure @ord@ mortality from cause other than breast cancer will depend mainly on age , on various other epidemiological risk factor , and on whether some life-threatening disease other than breast cancer be already present .
for woman less than @card@ year of age at diagnosis , the ratio of these 10-year breast cancer mortality risk be @card@ ( @card@ % vs @card@ % ) , whereas for woman @card@ - @card@ year of age , it be @card@ ( @card@ % vs @card@ % : figure @card@ ) . these ratio suggest that , in the absence of other cause of death , a 10-year breast cancer mortality of @card@ % might be reduce to about @card@ % ( age @card@ ) or @card@ % ( age @card@ - @card@ ) , and that a 10-year risk of @card@ % might be reduce to about @card@ % ( age @card@ ) or @card@ % ( age @card@ - @card@ year ) . these risk reduction be approximately as indicated ( for regimen such as fac or fec ) by the previous ebctcg report.1 if , however , the good of the drug combination test in these trial be to be give optimally then appreciably good result might be achieve .
overall , tamoxifen appear to be slightly protective in woman who be classify as have er-poor disease ( event rate ratio for each endpoint @card@ [ se @card@ ] in webfigure @card@ ) . however , this could well be because some of the woman who be classify as have er-poor disease in the early trial do , in fact , have some er expression and , hence , some er-mediated treatment effect . this apparent protective effect be somewhat strong in the trial of up to @card@ year of tamoxifen ( which typically begin around @card@ ) , whilst in the trial of @card@ or more ( mean @card@ ) year of tamoxifen versus not ( which typically begin more recently and involve about @card@ woman who be classify as have er-poor disease ) there be no apparent protective effect ( webfigure @card@ ) , suggest that even @card@ year of tamoxifen have little or no effect on disease that really be er-absent .
current and future chemotherapy regimen could be substantially more effective than the regimen in these trial and could , therefore , yield substantially well proportional risk reduction ; future ebctcg report will address this directly . if in some category of patient with er-absent disease ( as , for example , those with small , well-differentiated , node-negative tumour ) the absolute risk be low even without adjuvant chemotherapy then the absolute benefit from a give proportional risk reduction will also be low . if , however , the risk of recurrence in any category of untreated er-absent disease be substantial , then even these old regimen could produce an appreciable absolute reduction in it , as indicate by figure @card@ .
