the protein phosphatase 1d magnesium-dependent , delta isoform ( ppm1d or wip1 ) , a member of the protein phosphatase 2 c ( pp2c ) family , is expressed under various stress conditions , such as ionizing radiation and ultraviolet light , in a p53-dependent manner [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] . ppm1d has been previously proposed to influence multiple stress response pathways in the cell . first of all , ppm1d modulates p38 mapk signaling cascade both in vivo and in vitro by dephosphorylating the threonine 180 residue of p38 mapk [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] . ppm1d thereby reduces the kinase activity of p38 mapk and thus also its ability to phosphorylate and activate the p53 tumor suppressor protein [ 3 ] . similarly , ppm1d efficiently dephosphorylates the serine residues on p53 itself , as well as atm , chk1 , chk2 , and ung2 , all of which are key cell cycle checkpoint effectors or dna damage response and repair proteins [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] and [ 10 ] . in addition , ppm1d has been suggested to inhibit p16ink4a and p19arf tumor suppressor activities [ 4 ] . together , these data support an essential role for ppm1d as a homeostatic regulator of multiple cellular growth and stress regulatory responses and dna damage repair pathways .
ppm1d is frequently amplified and overexpressed in primary human breast cancers as well as in several other human tumor types , including neuroblastomas , ovarian clear cell adenocarcinomas , and medulloblastomas [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] . furthermore , ppm1d amplification and overexpression is associated with poor clinical outcome [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] and [ 16 ] . interestingly , the majority of primary breast tumors that overexpress ppm1d have a structurally intact tp53 gene [ 11 ] and [ 16 ] . this finding supports the hypothesis that ppm1d activation represents an alternative mechanism that leads to inactivation of p53 in cancer ; p53 mutation and ppm1d activation are therefore mutually exclusive events that elicit the same end result .
several lines of evidence implicate ppm1d in cancer pathogenesis . first of all , in vitro studies have demonstrated that ppm1d can complement ras , myc , and neu oncogenes for cellular transformation of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts [ 11 ] and [ 12 ] . recently , ppm1d was also found to promote tumorigenesis in vivo in mouse mammary epithelium in cooperation with the erbb2 ( neu ) oncogene [ 17 ] . based on these data , ppm1d can be regarded as a weak oncogene . in contrast , the absence of ppm1d was shown to lead to tumor resistant phenotype . ppm1d-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts were resistant to transformation with several different oncogenes and inactivation of ppm1d also inhibited mammary tumorigenesis in these animals [ 4 ] and [ 18 ] .
together , these studies illustrate that ppm1d is clearly involved in cellular stress responses and tumor development and thus could be considered as a promising cancer therapy target . the data on the function of ppm1d , however , have been derived almost exclusively from in vitro and in vivo mouse studies . the exact role of ppm1d in the pathogenesis of human breast cancer has not been fully established . in this study , we used an rna interference ( rnai ) technique to silence ppm1d expression in breast cancer cell lines to explore the function and phenotypic consequences of ppm1d overexpression in human breast cancer .
2. materials and methods2.1 . cell lines and cell culture
twenty-one breast cancer cell lines were used in this study , obtained from the american type culture collection ( atcc , manassas , va ) : bt-474 , cama-1 , du4475 , hcc38 , hcc1419 , hcc1954 , mcf7 , mda-134 , mda-157 , mda-361 , mda-415 , mda-436 , mda-453 , sk-br-3 , t-47d , uacc-732 , uacc-812 , uacc-893 , uacc-3133 , zr-75-1 , and zr-75-30 . normal human mammary epithelial cells ( hmec ) were obtained from clonetics ( walkersville , md ) . cells were grown under recommended culture conditions .
2.2. fluorescence in situ hybridization
two bacterial artificial chromosome ( bac ) clones corresponding to the ppm1d gene ( rp11-634f5 and rp11-1081e4 ) were identified by performing sequence similarity searches against the nonredundant and high-throughput genomic sequence databases ( http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/ ) . the clone identity was verified by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and bac dna was labeled with spectrumorange-dutp ( abbott molecular - vysis , des plaines , il ) by random priming . a spectrumgreen-labeled chromosome 17 centromeric probe ( abbott molecular - vysis ) was used as a reference .
fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) to normal human metaphase chromosomes was done to confirm that the two clone contig recognized a single copy target at 17q23 . dual-color interphase fish to breast cancer cell lines was done as previously described [ 19 ] , and the hybridization signals were analyzed using an olympus bx50 epifluorescence microscope ( tokyo , japan ) equipped with a 60 objective ( numerical aperture na = 1.4 ) . approximately 50 nonoverlapping nuclei were scored to determine the mean number of hybridization signals for both ppm1d and reference probes . amplification was defined as a 3-fold increase in the number of ppm1d probe signals , compared with the chromosome 17 centromere signals .
2.3. rna preparation and northern blot hybridization
northern blot hybridization was performed using standard methods . briefly , 15 g of total rna , extracted from breast cancer cell lines by using trizol reagent ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) , was loaded onto 1 % formaldehyde gel , electrophoresed , and transferred onto a nytran supercharge membrane ( schleicher schuell bioscience , dassel , germany ) by turboblotter ( schleicher schuell bioscience ) . sequence-verified insert from ppm1d-specific cdna clone was labeled with 32p by random priming ( rediprime ii ; amersham biosciences , piscataway , nj ; buckinghamshire , england ) and purified with nuctrap probe purification columns using a push column beta shield device ( stratagene , la jolla , ca ) .
the membrane was prehybridized for 1 hour at 42c in northernmax prehybridization/hybridization buffer ( ambion , austin , tx ) containing 10 g/ml denatured herring sperm dna ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo ) . an overnight hybridization using labeled ppm1d probe was performed in the prehybridization solution at 42c . the membrane was washed twice with 2 saline sodium citrate ( ssc ) - 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) at room temperature and then twice in 0.1 ssc - 0.1 % sds at 55c . the hybridized probe was detected by using a phosphorimager system ( molecular dynamics , sunnyvale , ca ) . after removal of the bound probe , the membrane was rehybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe ( clontech , palo alto , ca ) to confirm equal loading of the samples .
2.4. quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase pcr
total rna was isolated using an rneasy mini kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca ) and was reverse-transcribed using a superscript first-strand synthesis system ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) . dna hybridization probe sets for ppm1d and the housekeeping gene tata box binding protein ( tbp ) were obtained from tib molbiol ( berlin , germany ) . the analyses were performed as previously described [ 16 ] . the relative ppm1d expression levels were determined by dividing the ppm1d value by the tbp value for each sample .
2.5. ppm1d silencing
three of the breast cancer cell lines were used in small interfering rna ( sirna ) experiments : bt-474 , mcf7 , and zr-75-1 . scrambled nonsilencing control sirna and three sirnas against ppm1d were designed according to elbashir et al . [ 20 ] ( table 1 ) . cells were transfected with sirna using the oligofectamine protocol according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( invitrogen ) .

to explore whether the reduction in cell number was caused by reduced cell proliferation or by increased cell death , we subjected the ppm1d and control sirna-transfected cells to cell cycle and apoptosis analyses . downregulation of ppm1d did not induce any changes in cell cycle distribution or in the quantity of apoptotic cells in bt-474 and mcf7 cell lines ( data not shown ) . for zr-75-1 cells , no effects on cell cycle parameters were observed at the 24-hour and 48-hour time points ; however , a statistically significant ( p 0.01 ) increase of cells in s and g2 phase , as well as a concomitant decrease of cells in g1 phase , was detected at 72 hours after transfection ( fig . 4a ) . ppm1d silencing also significantly increased ( p 0.01 ) the quantity of apoptotic ( including early apoptotic and apoptotic or necrotic cells ) zr-75-1 cells at 48 and 72 hours ( fig . 4b ) . furthermore , the quantity of dead zr-75-1 cells was also significantly ( p 0.01 ) increased at the 72-hour time point , compared with control sirna-treated cells ( fig . 4c ) .

4. discussion
ppm1d is a growth-promoting phosphatase that acts as a weak oncogene in transformation assays by complementing the action of various oncogenes [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] and [ 17 ] . ppm1d is also commonly amplified and overexpressed in a number of human malignancies , and this event has been associated with more aggressive disease [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] and [ 16 ] . furthermore , analysis of ppm1d-null mice has revealed defects in reproductive organs , immune function , and cell cycle control , indicating that ppm1d has a number of important biological functions [ 21 ] and [ 22 ] .
in this study , we concentrated on exploring the functional role of ppm1d overexpression in breast cancer . to this end , we applied rnai technology to specifically downregulate ppm1d mrna levels in breast cancer cell lines harboring amplification and overexpression of this gene . our analyses revealed that ppm1d silencing has a strong antiproliferative effect in zr-75-1 breast cancer cells . less dramatic reduction in cell growth was also observed in mcf7 cells , and bt-474 cells showed no change in cell growth rate .
these differences in cell behavior are intriguing , given that all three cell lines do have high levels of ppm1d expression and there was no substantial difference in the efficiency of ppm1d silencing . one aspect that might explain these diverse responses is the p53 status of the cells . zr-75-1 and mcf7 cells carry wild-type p53 , whereas bt-474 harbors mutant p53 [ 23 ] . because inactivation of p53 is one of the main consequences of ppm1d activation [ 3 ] , it could be expected that ppm1d downregulation does not have an effect on cell growth in p53-deficient cells , such as bt-474 . our data thus suggest that the antiproliferative effect of ppm1d is dependent on the p53 status of the cells . it is also possible , however , that other factors contribute to the differential response of ppm1d silencing in these cell lines . for example , bt-474 cells may not be dependent on ppm1d but rather rely on other proliferation and survival pathways .
the mechanisms that lead to reduced cell growth in zr-75-1 and mcf7 cells after ppm1d silencing are not completely clear . the flow cytometric cell cycle analysis showed a larger fraction of zr-75-1 cells in s and g2 phase of the cell cycle after ppm1d sirna than for the control sirna treatment ; however , this effect was observed only at 72 hours after transfection and is thus likely to reflect contact inhibition in the fully confluent control sirna cultures , rather than an actual change in the cell cycle profile in ppm1d-depleted cells . because of their slower growth rate , the ppm1d sirna-transfected cells had not yet reached confluency at this time point . in contrast , our data do suggest that ppm1d downregulation leads to increased apoptosis in zr-75-1 cells and therefore the reduced growth rate is likely to be explained by induction of programmed cell death . similar induction of apoptosis was not observed in mcf7 cells , and thus the growth reduction observed in these cells remains unexplained . nevertheless , our data suggest the involvement of ppm1d in regulation of essential prosurvival pathways .
our results from breast cancer are consistent with a previous report on neuroblastoma cell lines , in which ppm1d silencing was also shown to suppress cell growth and induce apoptosis [ 13 ] . furthermore , ppm1d knockdown has earlier been found to enhance apoptosis after dna damage and e2f1 induction [ 9 ] and [ 24 ] . these findings are further corroborated by data demonstrating decreased proliferative capacity and premature senescence in mouse embryo fibroblasts from ppm1d-null mice [ 4 ] and [ 21 ] . moreover , recent studies have also indicated that small-molecule inhibitors of ppm1d are capable of reducing tumor cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo [ 25 ] . taken together , these findings confirm the role of ppm1d in regulation of cell proliferation and further implicate it as an essential regulator of cell survival in breast cancer . based on these characteristics , ppm1d is an appealing target for the development of novel anticancer treatments .
