cadmium ( cd ) is a heavy metal that is widely distributed throughout the environment as a result of pollution from a variety of sources . the environmental exposure to cd occurs through contaminated food and cigarette smoke . for the general population , tobacco smoking is an important source of cd exposure ( who/icps , 1992 ) . cd is classified as a category i carcinogen by the international agency for research on cancer ( iarc , 1993 ) . however , in comparison with the other carcinogenic metals , cd is not a strong cancer initiator and instead , it is a weak mutagen ( rossman et al. , 1992 ) . cd-induced stimulation of cellular signaling at various stages of the mitogenic cascade , such as proto-oncogene expression , dna synthesis , and cell proliferation in various mammalian cell systems , is thought to be the mechanisms for the carcinogenic action of this metal .
during the last decade , a growing body of evidence has accumulated suggest , that , in certain cell types , micromolar concentration of cd is able to initiate a series of rapid signaling events including : generation of second massagers ( ip3 , camp ) within 15 - 30 s ( [ smith et al. , 1989 ] and [ yamagami et al. , 1998 ] ) ; increase in intracellular calcium within 3 min ( [ smith et al. , 1989 ] and [ yamagami et al. , 1998 ] ) ; activation of certain kinases ( [ hung et al. , 1998 ] , [ galan et al. , 2000 ] , [ misra et al. , 2002 ] and [ misra et al. , 2003 ] ) ; and induction of early response genes c-fos and c-myc within 30 min ( [ beyersmann and hechtenberg , 1997 ] , [ misra et al. , 2002 ] and [ misra et al. , 2003 ] ) . since these signals are generated soon after cd exposure , it argues against a physiological interaction between cd and intracellular proteins . it has been postulated that cd might bind to and activate a putative cell membrane receptor and trigger the downstream signaling events . however , only a limited number of studies ( [ misra et al. , 2002 ] and [ misra et al. , 2003 ] ) have explored this possibility , and there is no definitive study that elucidates the nature of the receptor that might possibly mediate this effect .
estrogen can modulate cellular functions through non-genomic actions which are initiated from the cell membrane . there are two proposed models for the rapid response to estrogen action . the first model proposes that the membrane-bound estrogen receptor alpha ( mer ) is associated with the cell membrane proteins , including g protein and receptor tyrosine kinase , and mediates the rapid signaling induced by estrogen ( [ razandi et al. , 2003a ] , [ razandi et al. , 2003b ] , [ razandi et al. , 2004 ] and [ pedram et al. , 2006 ] ) . the second model proposes that another membrane g protein-coupled protein , gpr30 is involved in this process ( [ filardo et al. , 2000 ] , [ filardo et al. , 2002 ] , [ norman et al. , 2004 ] , [ hewitt et al. , 2005 ] , [ revankar et al. , 2005 ] and [ thomas et al. , 2005 ] ) . although the nature of mer is still debated ( [ song and santen , 2006 ] and [ warner and gustafsson , 2006 ] ) , there is evidence that in certain cell types , a small fraction of er , that is associated with the cell membrane and originates from the same transcript of classical er , is required for rapid effects of estrogen ( [ razandi et al. , 2003a ] , [ razandi et al. , 2003b ] , [ razandi et al. , 2004 ] , [ song et al. , 2004 ] and [ pedram et al. , 2006 ] ) .
at relatively low doses ( 5 - 10 g/kg , ip ) , cd is able to increase uterine weight , promote growth and development of mammary gland , and induce hormone-regulated genes in ovariectomized rats ( johnson et al. , 2003 ) . as a xenoestrogen , cd has the ability to bind to er with high affinity ( kd = 4.5 10 10 ) , and activate and alter estrogen target gene transcription and expression ( [ garcia-morales et al. , 1994 ] and [ stoica et al. , 2000 ] ) . if the non-genomic effects of 17-estradiol ( e2 ) are mediated by mer , it is conceivable that cd may also trigger a rapid signaling cascade by the same mechanism .
mitogen activated protein kinases ( mapks ) are serine/threonine protein kinases that play important roles in the signaling cascades regulating cellular process such as cell proliferation , differentiation and apoptosis . three major subfamilies have been described : extracellular-regulated kinases ( erk ) , c-jun n-terminal kinase ( jnk ) , and p38 kinase . depending on the cellular context and stimulators , there is a significant cross talk between transduction modules as they can respond to a common upstream activator and phosphorylate common down stream target . in general , the erk pathway is preferentially activated in response to growth and differentiation factors , while jnk and p38 kinase are more sensitive to stress stimuli including heat shock , inflammatory cytokines , ultraviolet and gamma irradiation , and hyperosmolarity ( roux and blenis , 2004 ) . the cells show different temporal and dose-response patterns to cd treatment in terms of activation of mapks . among the three major subfamilies of mapks , erk1/2 is usually activated by cd much earlier than jnk and p38 kinase ( [ alam et al. , 2000 ] , [ chuang et al. , 2000 ] , [ chuang and yang , 2001 ] , [ huang et al. , 2001 ] and [ iryo et al. , 2000 ] ) . additionally , rapid activation of erk1/2 is widely used as an endpoint to reflect e2-induced non-genomic effects in a variety of cell types ( [ filardo et al. , 2000 ] , [ filardo et al. , 2002 ] , [ razandi et al. , 2003a ] , [ razandi et al. , 2003b ] , [ razandi et al. , 2004 ] and [ pedram et al. , 2006 ] ) .
the activation of either erk1/2 or akt , or both pro-survival kinases , could prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis induced by certain chemical or physical agents . the serine/threonine protein kinase pi3k/akt is also activated by various growth and survival factors . akt promotes cell survival through two distinct pathways : inhibition of apoptosis by phosphorylation of the bad component of the bad/bcl - xl complex , causing dissociation of the bad/bcl - xl complex and allowing cell survival ; and activation of ikk that ultimately leads to nf-kb activation and cell survival ( hennessy et al. , 2005 ) . e2 can induce the activation of akt in endothelial cells from wild type mice within 15 min , but not in cells from er/er combined-deleted mice ( pedram et al. , 2006 ) . misra et al . ( 2003 ) reported that in 1ln prostate cells akt was activated by 1 m cd within 20 min .
the present study was designed to investigate rapid signaling in response to cd in three human breast cancer cell lines with different expression profiles for er , er and gpr30 .

cell culture
the three breast cancer cell lines , mcf-7 ( er- , er- , and gpr30-positive ) , mda-mb-231 ( er-positive ) , and sk-br-3 ( gpr30 positive ) , were purchased from american type culture collection ( mannassas , va ) . the cells were grown and maintained in phenol red-free dmem/ham 's f12 medium ( 1:1 ) containing 1.2 g/l sodium bicarbonate , 10 % fbs and 50 mg/l gentamicin ( [ filardo et al. , 2000 ] and [ filardo et al. , 2002 ] ) . stock cultures were maintained in the complete medium in a humidified atmosphere of 95 % air 5 % co2 at 37 c and employed for experiments within 15 serial passages . the cells were sub-cultivated every 6 - 7 days using a mixture of 0.25 % trypsin and 0.03 % edta .
cell exposure and preparation of cell extract
the cells ( 1 105/cm2 ) were seeded in t-75 flasks or 6-well cell culture plates in phenol red-free dmem/f-12 medium containing 10 % fbs . the next day , the medium was replaced with the phenol red-free , serum-free medium and the cells were maintained for 48 h. treatment of quiescent cells ( 60 % - 80 % confluences ) with cd was carried out at 37 c in phenol red-free , serum-free , medium as described in the fig . legends . since 10 m cd has been commonly used by other researchers for studying the effects of cd on mapks ( [ chuang et al. , 2000 ] , [ chuang and yang , 2001 ] , [ huang et al. , 2001 ] and [ iryo et al. , 2000 ] ) , the same concentration was used in the present study for comparison with the earlier reports . as determined by the mtt and trypan blue exclusion assays , treatment of cells with 10 m cd for 60 min did not cause cytotoxicity ( data not show ) . at the end of cd treatment , the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline ( pbs ) and lysed with ice-cold ripa buffer ( 150 mm sodium chloride , 100 mm tris , ph 7.5 , 1 % deoxycholatic sodium , 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) , 1 % triton x-100 , 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate , 3.5 mm navo4 , 2 mm pmsf , 50 mm naf , 2 mm edta , plus protease inhibitor cocktail at a ratio of 1000:1 ) . the cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 g for 15 min and the supernatants were stored at 80 c until analyzed . the protein concentration was determined using micro bca reagent kit from pierce biotechnology ( rockford , il ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
western blot analysis
prior to electrophoresis , the cell extracts were heated at 95 - 100 c for 5 min in laemmli buffer containing 5 % -mecaptoethanol . the amount of protein in the extract used for electrophoresis was kept constant in the same experiment but varied between the experiments ( 15 - 30 g ) . after electrophoresis , the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 20 v for 20 min by using trans-blot sd semi-dry transfer cell ( bio-rad , hercules , ca ) . the membranes were then blocked with the li-cor blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in pbs-0.1 % tween-20 containing 2.5 % bsa ( pbst-bsa ) overnight at 4 c or for 1 h at room temperature . the nitrocellulose membranes were washed and incubated with secondary antibody labeled with alexa fluor 680 ( 1:15,000 diluted in blocking buffer containing 0.1 % tween-20 ) for 1 h , followed by extensive washing with pbs-0.1 % tween-20 . the washed membranes were scanned with the odyssey infrared imager ( li-cor , lincon , ne ) and the optical density of the bands was quantified by using the application software version 1.2.15 .
transfection with the small interfering rna ( sirna )
the sirna transfection was conducted according to the instructions provided by dharmacon tech ( lafayette , co ) . briefly , the cells were transfected with either non-specific sirna ( control ) or sirna against human er ( her ) , and allowed to recover overnight . the cells were serum-deprived for 24 h prior to treatment with cd .
data analysis
each experiment was repeated three times and the optical density data were statistically analyzed for significant differences by one-way anova , followed by the tukey - kramer test , at p 0.05 .
results activation of erk1/2
the presence of phosphorylated threonine and tyrosine residues in mapk correlates with the activities of kinases . thus , to assess activated erk1/2 levels , the cell extracts were processed using western blot analyses using antibodies against phosphorylated peptides encompassing erk1/2 residues . first , the time-course of cd-induced erk1/2 activation was compared between the mcf-7 , mda-mb-231 , and sk-br-3 cells . e2 was used as a positive control and response pattern comparisons were made between e2 ( 10 nm ) and cd ( 10 m ) . the effect of medium change on the erk1/2 phosphorylation was examined in untreated mcf-7 cells and no significant changes were observed ( data not shown ) . as depicted in fig . 1a , b , g , and h , the temporal response pattern of erk1/2 activation induced by cd in mcf-7 cells was similar to that induced by e2 . maximal erk1/2 activation by both e2 and cd was observed at 2.5 min followed by a gradual decrease over the 60 min period . in contrast to the mcf-7 cells , neither cd nor e2 activated erk1/2 in the mda-mb-231 cells that express only er ( fig . 1c , d , g , and h ) . however , in the sk-br-3 cells , that express only gpr30 , both cd and e2 caused transient activation of erk1/2 ( fig . 1e , f , g , and h ) , similar to that observed in the mcf-7 cells . these results indicated that mer and gpr30 , but not er were important in cd-induced rapid signaling of erk1/2 .

activation of akt
since akt is activated through phosphorylation of threonine by an upstream kinase , the activation of akt can be detected by western blot analysis using a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes the peptide containing threonine residues . as with erk1/2 , medium change had no significant effect on the phosphorylation of akt in the untreated mcf-7 cells ( data not shown ) . as shown in fig . 3a and g , cd significantly increased ( 3.3-fold ) the phosphorylated akt in mcf-7 cells within 2.5 min and continued to do so ( 5.4-fold ) for the duration of the experiment . the e2- induced akt activation exhibited a similar pattern ( fig . 3b and h ) . in the mda-mb-231 cells , cd but not e2 induced a moderate activation of akt only at 60 min ( fig . 3c , d , g and h ) . in comparison , akt phosphorylation in the sk-br-3 cells was not affected by either cd or e2 at any time , similar to the response of these cells to erk1/2 phosphorylation . thus , these data also pointed to the involvement of mer in akt signaling by cd .

phosphorylation of er
the results obtained for both erk1/2 and akt phosphorylation in the mcf-7 cells suggested that mer might play a role in cd-induced rapid signaling . thus , to further delineate its involvement in signaling process , the phosphorylation of er was investigated in quiescent mcf-7 cells after treatment with cd and e2 . as shown in fig . 4a and c , cd transiently elevated ( 3.9-fold ) the level of phosphorylated receptor at 2.5 min . in comparison , e2 caused a gradual and more sustained er phosphorylation ( fig . 4b ) .

effect of an estrogen antagonist on erk1/2 and akt activation
since e2-induced rapid activation of erk1/2 in mcf-7 cells is through mer , ici 182,780 , an estrogen antagonist , is able to antagonize both e2-induced genomic and non-genomic rapid signaling effects . in the present study , the possible role of mer in cd-induced rapid signaling was examined using the same antagonist . the quiescent mcf-7 cells were pretreated with 10 m ici 182,780 for 15 min , and then treated with 10 m cd or 10 nm e2 for 2.5 min in the presence of the antagonist . the ici 182,780 stock solution ( 10 mm ) was prepared in ethanol , thus the control cells were incubated with medium containing 0.1 % ethanol . as depicted in fig . 5a - d , whereas the antagonist completed blocked the e2-induced phosphorylation of both kinases . it had no significant effect on the cd-induced phosphorylation of either kinase . lack of effect of cd-induced activation of erk1/2 and akt by the receptor antagonist was contrary to all the other results obtained thus far and suggested an mer-independent mechanism .

effect of sirna against her on erk1/2 activation
to further evaluate the role of mer in cd-induced rapid activation of erk1/2 and akt , a second approach was utilized in which specific sirna was used to knockdown the expression of the receptor . transfection with her sirna markedly , but not completely , suppressed the expression er in quiescent mcf-7 cells ( fig . 6a and b ) . this level of suppression of er expression was sufficient to completely block the e2-induced rapid activation of both erk1/2 and akt ( figs . 6a - d ) . in comparison , it only partially blocked ( 60 % ) the cd-induced activation of erk1/2 ( fig . 6a and c ) , but completely blocked the activation of akt ( fig . 6b and d ) . these results suggest that , in addition to mer , other receptors might also be involved in interacting with cd .

discussion
cd has been described as an endocrine disrupting chemical by a number of investigators ( [ takiguchi and yoshihara , 2006 ] and [ henson and chedrese , 2004 ] ) . as a xenoestrogen , cd can alter the expression of certain estrogen target genes and affect breast tissue development in ovariectomized rats ( johnson et al. , 2003 ) . other metals , such as arsenic and uranium have also been evaluated for the reproductive tissue effects , but cd is the only one with demonstrated effects on mammary proliferation ( [ johnson et al. , 2003 ] and [ fenton , 2006 ] ) . although there is no definitive epidemiological evidence showing a positive relationship between cd exposure and breast cancer incidence in the general population ( [ nagata et al. , 2005 ] and [ mcelroy et al. , 2006 ] ) , as a xenoestrogen , cd may play a role in cancer promotion and progression after the cancer is initiated ( [ brody and rudel , 2003 ] and [ yager and davidson , 2006 ] ) . the mechanism by which cd disrupts endocrine function remains poorly understood .
the results obtained in the present study demonstrated that in mcf-7 cells , a relatively benign breast cancer cell line , cd was able to rapidly activate erk1/2 , akt and er at a micromolar concentration within 2.5 min . under the same exposure condition , sk-br-3 cells , a moderately malignant breast cancer cell line , responded a bit more slowly ( 7.5 min ) in terms of erk1/2 activation . in comparison , a highly invasive breast cancer cell line , mda-mb-231 , did not show a rapid response to cd treatment at all . from the dramatic response differences between these three cell lines , it could be speculated that sensitivity to cd might be associated with the relative invasiveness of the breast cancer cells .
since activation of both erk1/2 and akt plays a role in regulating various cellular processes such as cell growth , cell differentiation , and apoptosis induced by certain chemical or physical agents , more studies need to be performed to further elucidate how cd-induced rapid signaling affects the normal function of breast tissue and it 's susceptibility to certain stresses . in the present study , cd also induced rapid phosphorylation of er , which might make the cells more sensitive to relatively low levels of e2 . although the downstream effects were not investigated in the present study , the results of erk1/2 , akt and er phosphorylation suggest that even occasional exposure to cd might cause transient effects on the normal physiology of the breast tissue and might disrupt the normal homeostasis , especially if the exposure occurs in early critical period of breast development ( fenton , 2006 ) . the potential short-term exposure to low concentration of cd is of environmental health importance and may have biological significance , especially when the subjects are co-exposed to other chemicals or physical stress agents ( brody and rudel , 2003 ) .
the results presented in this study also showed that cd , like e2 , caused rapid phosphorylation of erk1/2 in mcf-7 cells only 2.5 min after treatment . this suggests that cd and e2 possibly share a similar downstream signal transduction pathway and regulatory mechanism . the rapid inactivation of erk1/2 implies the existence of a tightly controlled regulatory mechanism . in contrast to these results , silva et al . ( 2006 ) reported that 0.1 m cd did not induce significant activation of erk1/2 in mcf-7 bus cells during the 5 - 20 min treatment period . although the differences in biological characteristics and sensitivity to e2 and endocrine disruptors among various mcf-7 cell stocks may partially contribute to the differences in cd-induced rapid activation of erk1/2 ( villalobos et al. , 1995 ) , it is also possible that 0.1 m cd is too low a concentration to detect any significant effects . in this regard , the present study provided a more comprehensive concentration-response data about cd-induced rapid signaling in the mcf-7 cells between 0.5 and 10 m concentration .
alam et al . ( 2000 ) reported increased phosphorylation of erk1/2 in the mcf-7 cells in response to cd starting at 15 min and peaking at 1 h. they used mcf-7 n variant cells which could partly account for their results and those reported in the present study ( burow et al. , 1998 ) . secondly , these investigators used dmem containing phenol red , and performed 24 h serum starvation before exposure . the present study utilized phenol red-free dmem/f-12 medium and serum starved the cells for 48 h. matsuoka and igisu ( 2001 ) have shown that without serum starvation , 20 m cd induces significant phosphorylation of erk1/2 in mcf-7 cells only after 18 h of exposure . furthermore , because phenol-red is a weak estrogen mimic , it can interfere with the effects of estrogen . therefore , phenol-red should be excluded from the medium when studying the effects of estrogen or endocrine disruptors . additionally , since erk1/2 can be activated very rapidly , early time points need to be considered in designing such studies .
guerra et al . ( 2004 ) observed that short treatment of septal murine cells ( sn56 ) with e2 caused a biphasic activation of erk1/2 , with peak induction at 4 - 8 min in the early phase and 8 h in the second phase . similarly , marino et al . ( 2003 ) reported that treatment of hepg2 cells with e2 also caused a biphasic phosphorylation of akt with peaks at 3 and 30 min , respectively . furthermore , that the first wave of activation was er-independent , whereas the second was er-dependent .
brama et al . ( 2007 ) studied cd-induced activation of erk1/2 and akt in the mcf-7 cells and reported maximum activation between 3 and 6 h. they concluded that this activation occurred through an er-dependent mechanism , because it could be fully blocked by ici 182,780. in comparison , in the present study , cd caused rapid activation of erk1/2 at 2.5 min in the mcf-7 cells and while it was not blocked by ici 182,780 , it was partially blocked in cells transfected with her . thus , cd like e2 appears to induce a biphasic activation of erk1/2 and both the early and late phases possibly involve er .
besides the breast cancer cells , the activation of erk1/2 by cd has been reported in several other cell types , including human t lymphoblastoid ccrf-cem cells , non-small-cell lung carcinoma cell line cl3 , and mouse epidermal jb6 c141 cells ( [ iryo et al. , 2000 ] , [ chuang et al. , 2000 ] , [ chuang and yang , 2001 ] and [ huang et al. , 2001 ] ) . the phosphorylation of erk1/2 in the ccrf-cem cells treated with 10 m cd occurred after 30 min exposure ( iryo et al. , 2000 ) . in non-small-cell lung carcinoma cell line cl3 , high concentration of cd ( 80 m ) induced phosphorylation of erk1/2 after 6 h of treatment ( chuang et al. , 2000 ) . similarly , in mouse epidermal cells , huang et al . ( 2001 ) reported that 1 m cd induced a sustained activation of erk1/2 between 20 min and 9 h. wang and templeton ( 1998 ) reported that erk1/2 activation in rat mesangial cells was involved in cd-induced c-fos mrna transcription and that inhibition of erk1/2 partially attenuated cd-induced c-fos transcription . thus different cell lines show variations in response to cd-induced activation of erk1/2 in terms of time-course and concentration-dependence . it is likely that multiple mechanisms are involved in mediating this effect and that certain biological responses are cell type specific .
an important finding in this study was that the mda-mb-231 cells , that express only er , did not respond to cd , ruling out the involvement of this receptor in cd signaling . another membrane receptor , gpr30 , has been shown to be involved in rapid e2 signaling events ( [ filardo et al. , 2000 ] and [ filardo et al. , 2002 ] ) . since the skbr-3 cells containing gpr30 responded to cd , this receptor also appears to interact with cd .
in conclusion , the results presented here provide evidence that micromolar concentration of cd rapidly activate erk1/2 and akt in the mcf-7 and sk-br-3 cells . this process seems to involve mer and gpr30 . it is plausible that cd could also bind to other membrane receptors , upstream kinases or g-protein coupled proteins , which are associated with specialized cell membrane structural complexes , such as caveolae , causing rapid activation of downstream kinase cascade ( [ wong et al. , 2002 ] and [ chini and parenti , 2004 ] ) . further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of cd-induced rapid signaling and to better understand how cd interferes with the cell signaling network , affects normal physiological function and homeostasis .
