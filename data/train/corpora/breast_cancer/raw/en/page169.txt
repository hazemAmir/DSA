The protein phosphatase 1D magnesium-dependent, delta isoform (PPM1D or WIP1), a member of the protein phosphatase 2 C (PP2C) family, is expressed under various stress conditions, such as ionizing radiation and ultraviolet light, in a p53-dependent manner [1], [2] and [3]. PPM1D has been previously proposed to influence multiple stress response pathways in the cell. First of all, PPM1D modulates p38 MAPK signaling cascade both in vivo and in vitro by dephosphorylating the threonine 180 residue of p38 MAPK [3] and [4]. PPM1D thereby reduces the kinase activity of p38 MAPK and thus also its ability to phosphorylate and activate the p53 tumor suppressor protein [3]. Similarly, PPM1D efficiently dephosphorylates the serine residues on p53 itself, as well as ATM, Chk1, Chk2, and UNG2, all of which are key cell cycle checkpoint effectors or DNA damage response and repair proteins [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] and [10]. In addition, PPM1D has been suggested to inhibit p16INK4A and p19ARF tumor suppressor activities [4]. Together, these data support an essential role for PPM1D as a homeostatic regulator of multiple cellular growth and stress regulatory responses and DNA damage repair pathways.
PPM1D is frequently amplified and overexpressed in primary human breast cancers as well as in several other human tumor types, including neuroblastomas, ovarian clear cell adenocarcinomas, and medulloblastomas [11], [12], [13], [14], [15] and [16]. Furthermore, PPM1D amplification and overexpression is associated with poor clinical outcome [13], [14] and [16]. Interestingly, the majority of primary breast tumors that overexpress PPM1D have a structurally intact TP53 gene [11] and [16]. This finding supports the hypothesis that PPM1D activation represents an alternative mechanism that leads to inactivation of p53 in cancer; p53 mutation and PPM1D activation are therefore mutually exclusive events that elicit the same end result.
Several lines of evidence implicate PPM1D in cancer pathogenesis. First of all, in vitro studies have demonstrated that PPM1D can complement Ras, Myc, and Neu oncogenes for cellular transformation of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts [11] and [12]. Recently, PPM1D was also found to promote tumorigenesis in vivo in mouse mammary epithelium in cooperation with the ErbB2 (Neu) oncogene [17]. Based on these data, PPM1D can be regarded as a weak oncogene. In contrast, the absence of PPM1D was shown to lead to tumor resistant phenotype. Ppm1d-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts were resistant to transformation with several different oncogenes and inactivation of Ppm1d also inhibited mammary tumorigenesis in these animals [4] and [18].
Together, these studies illustrate that PPM1D is clearly involved in cellular stress responses and tumor development and thus could be considered as a promising cancer therapy target. The data on the function of PPM1D, however, have been derived almost exclusively from in vitro and in vivo mouse studies. The exact role of PPM1D in the pathogenesis of human breast cancer has not been fully established. In this study, we used an RNA interference (RNAi) technique to silence PPM1D expression in breast cancer cell lines to explore the function and phenotypic consequences of PPM1D overexpression in human breast cancer.
2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell lines and cell culture
Twenty-one breast cancer cell lines were used in this study, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA): BT-474, CAMA-1, DU4475, HCC38, HCC1419, HCC1954, MCF7, MDA-134, MDA-157, MDA-361, MDA-415, MDA-436, MDA-453, SK-BR-3, T-47D, UACC-732, UACC-812, UACC-893, UACC-3133, ZR-75-1, and ZR-75-30. Normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) were obtained from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD). Cells were grown under recommended culture conditions.
2.2. Fluorescence in situ hybridization
Two bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones corresponding to the PPM1D gene (RP11-634F5 and RP11-1081E4) were identified by performing sequence similarity searches against the nonredundant and high-throughput genomic sequence databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). The clone identity was verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and BAC DNA was labeled with SpectrumOrange-dUTP (Abbott Molecular - Vysis, Des Plaines, IL) by random priming. A SpectrumGreen-labeled chromosome 17 centromeric probe (Abbott Molecular - Vysis) was used as a reference.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to normal human metaphase chromosomes was done to confirm that the two clone contig recognized a single copy target at 17q23. Dual-color interphase FISH to breast cancer cell lines was done as previously described [19], and the hybridization signals were analyzed using an Olympus BX50 epifluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 60 objective (numerical aperture NA = 1.4). Approximately 50 nonoverlapping nuclei were scored to determine the mean number of hybridization signals for both PPM1D and reference probes. Amplification was defined as a 3-fold increase in the number of PPM1D probe signals, compared with the chromosome 17 centromere signals.
2.3. RNA preparation and Northern blot hybridization
Northern blot hybridization was performed using standard methods. Briefly, 15 g of total RNA, extracted from breast cancer cell lines by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), was loaded onto 1% formaldehyde gel, electrophoresed, and transferred onto a Nytran SuperCharge membrane (Schleicher Schuell BioScience, Dassel, Germany) by TurboBlotter (Schleicher Schuell BioScience). Sequence-verified insert from PPM1D-specific cDNA clone was labeled with 32P by random priming (rediprime II; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ; Buckinghamshire, England) and purified with NucTrap probe purification columns using a Push Column beta shield device (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).
The membrane was prehybridized for 1 hour at 42C in NorthernMax prehybridization/hybridization buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX) containing 10 g/mL denatured herring sperm DNA (Sigma - Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). An overnight hybridization using labeled PPM1D probe was performed in the prehybridization solution at 42C. The membrane was washed twice with 2 saline sodium citrate (SSC) - 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at room temperature and then twice in 0.1 SSC - 0.1% SDS at 55C. The hybridized probe was detected by using a PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). After removal of the bound probe, the membrane was rehybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to confirm equal loading of the samples.
2.4. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR
Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and was reverse-transcribed using a SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). DNA hybridization probe Sets for PPM1D and the housekeeping gene TATA box binding protein (TBP) were obtained from TIB MolBiol (Berlin, Germany). The analyses were performed as previously described [16]. The relative PPM1D expression levels were determined by dividing the PPM1D value by the TBP value for each sample.
2.5. PPM1D silencing
Three of the breast cancer cell lines were used in small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments: BT-474, MCF7, and ZR-75-1. Scrambled nonsilencing control siRNA and three siRNAs against PPM1D were designed according to Elbashir et al. [20] (Table 1). Cells were transfected with siRNA using the oligofectamine protocol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).

Briefly, 1 day prior to transfection, either 75,000 cells per well in a 24-well plate or 375,000 cells per well in a 6-well plate were plated in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and no antibiotics. The siRNA duplex mixed in Gibco OptiMEM I medium (Invitrogen), and the oligofectamine reagent mixed in OptiMEM I were each incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Subsequently, the two mixtures were combined and incubated at room temperature for an additional 20 minutes. The siRNA - oligofectamine complex was then added to the cells. Cells were incubated at 37C for 4 hours followed by addition of fresh culture medium (one third of the transfection volume) that included 30% FBS. The final concentration of siRNA duplex was 100 nmol/L.
All experiments were performed in three to six replicates and repeated at least twice. Downregulation of PPM1D was confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) after each transfection at all timepoints.
2.6. Cell growth assay
A total of 75,000 cells (BT-474, MCF7, and ZR-75-1) per well were seeded into 24-well cell culture plates and transfected with siRNAs. Cells were harvested at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after transfection and the cell numbers were calculated by using Z1 series Coulter Counter cell and particle counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).
2.7. Cell cycle analysis
Analysis of cell cycle distribution after siRNA transfection was performed using a Coulter Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). A total of 375,000 cells (BT-474, MCF7, and ZR-75-1) per well were seeded into 6-well cell culture plates; at 24, 48, and 72 hours after transfection with siRNAs, the cells were harvested and resuspended to 500 L of hypotonic staining buffer (0.1 mg/mL sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate, 0.03% Triton X-100, 50 g/mL propidium iodide [PI] and 2 g/mL RNase A in distilled H2O). After 30 minutes incubation on ice, a total of 20,000 PI-stained nuclei were analyzed using EXPO32 ADC version 1.2 analysis software (Beckman Coulter).
2.8. Apoptosis assay
A total of 375,000 cells (BT-474, MCF7, and ZR-75-1) per well were seeded into 6-well cell culture plates and at 24, 48, and 72 hours after siRNA treatment both floating and adherent cells were collected. The cell aliquots were combined, washed with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 1 binding buffer, and stained using the Annexin V apoptosis detection kit (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The fractions of annexin V and iodide PI staining cells were quantified by using an Coulter Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and were classified as early apoptotic (annexin V-positive, PI-negative cells), late apoptotic (annexin V positive, PI positive cells), or dead (annexin V negative, PI positive cells), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2.9. Statistical analyses
Statistical differences between PPM1D targeted siRNA and control siRNA treatments in cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were calculated using a nonparametric, two-tailed Mann - Whitney U-test.
3. Results
To select appropriate models for functional analyses, we first determined PPM1D copy number and mRNA expression levels in a large panel of 21 breast cancer cell lines using interphase FISH and Northern blot analysis. The copy number analysis demonstrated a 3-fold amplification of PPM1D in 6 of the 21 cell lines (29%): BT-474, MCF7, UACC-732, UACC-893, ZR-75-1, and ZR-75-30 (Figs. 1A and 1B). Increased PPM1D expression levels, compared with normal human mammary epithelial cells, were observed in five of the six cell lines with PPM1D amplification (Fig. 1C). As an exception, the UACC-893 cells with 3.5-fold amplification did not show high PPM1D mRNA levels. Based on these data, BT-474, MCF7, and ZR-75-1 cell lines displaying varying degrees of PPM1D amplification together with elevated mRNA expression were selected for functional experiments.

Three synthetic siRNA molecules (siRNA-1, siRNA-2, and siRNA-3) (Table 1) directed against different regions of the gene were designed, and their efficacy to reduce PPM1D expression was tested in BT-474, MCF7, and ZR-75-1 cells. All three siRNAs efficiently downregulated the level of the PPM1D transcript. The siRNA-3 had maximal and most consistent inhibitory effect (Fig. 2). A slightly better silencing efficiency was observed in BT-474 and ZR-75-1 cells (up to 85% downregulation for BT-474 and 80% for ZR-75-1) than in MCF7 cells (74% downregulation). The reduction in mRNA levels was first measured at 24 hours and still persisted at 96 hours after transfection (Fig. 2).

We first studied the effect of PPM1D silencing on proliferation of BT-474, MCF7, and ZR-75-1 cells by determining the cell numbers following PPM1D siRNA and control siRNA transfections at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. A statistically significant (P 0.01) reduction in cell growth was seen in both MCF7 and ZR-75-1 cell lines after PPM1D silencing (Fig. 3). In ZR-75-1 cells, the inhibition was more distinct and already evident at 2 days after transfection, whereas in MCF7 cells the growth reduction became apparent only at 72 hours. For both cell lines, the difference in cell growth was still present at day 4 (P 0.01). In contrast, no difference in cell growth could be observed between PPM1D and control siRNA-transfected BT-474 cells (Fig. 3).

To explore whether the reduction in cell number was caused by reduced cell proliferation or by increased cell death, we subjected the PPM1D and control siRNA-transfected cells to cell cycle and apoptosis analyses. Downregulation of PPM1D did not induce any changes in cell cycle distribution or in the quantity of apoptotic cells in BT-474 and MCF7 cell lines (data not shown). For ZR-75-1 cells, no effects on cell cycle parameters were observed at the 24-hour and 48-hour time points; however, a statistically significant (P 0.01) increase of cells in S and G2 phase, as well as a concomitant decrease of cells in G1 phase, was detected at 72 hours after transfection (Fig. 4A). PPM1D silencing also significantly increased (P 0.01) the quantity of apoptotic (including early apoptotic and apoptotic or necrotic cells) ZR-75-1 cells at 48 and 72 hours (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the quantity of dead ZR-75-1 cells was also significantly (P 0.01) increased at the 72-hour time point, compared with control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 4C).

4. Discussion
PPM1D is a growth-promoting phosphatase that acts as a weak oncogene in transformation assays by complementing the action of various oncogenes [11], [12] and [17]. PPM1D is also commonly amplified and overexpressed in a number of human malignancies, and this event has been associated with more aggressive disease [11], [12], [13], [14], [15] and [16]. Furthermore, analysis of Ppm1d-null mice has revealed defects in reproductive organs, immune function, and cell cycle control, indicating that PPM1D has a number of important biological functions [21] and [22].
In this study, we concentrated on exploring the functional role of PPM1D overexpression in breast cancer. To this end, we applied RNAi technology to specifically downregulate PPM1D mRNA levels in breast cancer cell lines harboring amplification and overexpression of this gene. Our analyses revealed that PPM1D silencing has a strong antiproliferative effect in ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. Less dramatic reduction in cell growth was also observed in MCF7 cells, and BT-474 cells showed no change in cell growth rate.
These differences in cell behavior are intriguing, given that all three cell lines do have high levels of PPM1D expression and there was no substantial difference in the efficiency of PPM1D silencing. One aspect that might explain these diverse responses is the p53 status of the cells. ZR-75-1 and MCF7 cells carry wild-type p53, whereas BT-474 harbors mutant p53 [23]. Because inactivation of p53 is one of the main consequences of PPM1D activation [3], it could be expected that PPM1D downregulation does not have an effect on cell growth in p53-deficient cells, such as BT-474. Our data thus suggest that the antiproliferative effect of PPM1D is dependent on the p53 status of the cells. It is also possible, however, that other factors contribute to the differential response of PPM1D silencing in these cell lines. For example, BT-474 cells may not be dependent on PPM1D but rather rely on other proliferation and survival pathways.
The mechanisms that lead to reduced cell growth in ZR-75-1 and MCF7 cells after PPM1D silencing are not completely clear. The flow cytometric cell cycle analysis showed a larger fraction of ZR-75-1 cells in S and G2 phase of the cell cycle after PPM1D siRNA than for the control siRNA treatment; however, this effect was observed only at 72 hours after transfection and is thus likely to reflect contact inhibition in the fully confluent control siRNA cultures, rather than an actual change in the cell cycle profile in PPM1D-depleted cells. Because of their slower growth rate, the PPM1D siRNA-transfected cells had not yet reached confluency at this time point. In contrast, our data do suggest that PPM1D downregulation leads to increased apoptosis in ZR-75-1 cells and therefore the reduced growth rate is likely to be explained by induction of programmed cell death. Similar induction of apoptosis was not observed in MCF7 cells, and thus the growth reduction observed in these cells remains unexplained. Nevertheless, our data suggest the involvement of PPM1D in regulation of essential prosurvival pathways.
Our results from breast cancer are consistent with a previous report on neuroblastoma cell lines, in which PPM1D silencing was also shown to suppress cell growth and induce apoptosis [13]. Furthermore, PPM1D knockdown has earlier been found to enhance apoptosis after DNA damage and E2F1 induction [9] and [24]. These findings are further corroborated by data demonstrating decreased proliferative capacity and premature senescence in mouse embryo fibroblasts from Ppm1d-null mice [4] and [21]. Moreover, recent studies have also indicated that small-molecule inhibitors of PPM1D are capable of reducing tumor cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo [25]. Taken together, these findings confirm the role of PPM1D in regulation of cell proliferation and further implicate it as an essential regulator of cell survival in breast cancer. Based on these characteristics, PPM1D is an appealing target for the development of novel anticancer treatments.
